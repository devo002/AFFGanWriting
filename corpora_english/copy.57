The
rest
of
the
men
there
said
nothing
but
you
could
see
they
were
hard
hit
They
were
simple
men
who
knew
lot
maybe
about
digging
for
gold
but
were
babes
in
arms
when
it
came
to
dealing
with

like
Pell
and
Fenton

the
rest
guess
we
better
hold

right

done
it

away
with
it

If
you
take
chance
on
getting
your
gold
to

we

watch
the

out

quite
see
how
all
this
fitted

himself
on
the

still
it

so
chimed
in
too
That
goes
for

If
they
do
try

hold
up

it

to
what

should
be
First
to
avoid
the
Thetans

not

out
Second
to

pretty
warily

just
how
much
freedom
we
can
take
with
safety
And
third
to
study
these
damned
Thetans
We
must
learn
all
we
can
about
them
Leaning
back
carries
the
message
And
we
start

Seder
showing
the
Matzos
that
they
resent
the
Bread
of
Poverty
which
our
were
eating
in
to
show
they

willing

learn

we
invite
anybody
who
wishes
to
partake
in
our
saying
Anybody
who
is
hungry
let
him
come
and
eat
Anybody
who
is
thirsty
let
him
come
and
drink
And
we
want
all
to
