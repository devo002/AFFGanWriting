g06-093-06|impossible that you might be willing to accept of
g06-093-07|this appointment. '
g06-096-00|The reply was not bereft of asperity: ' Beaudesert,
g06-096-01|Sept. 27, 1835 ' Dear Melbourne, ' I have received
g06-096-02|your letter of yesterday. ' I am not prepared to spend
g06-096-03|the remainder of my life at Gibraltar, & moreover
g06-096-04|( if even residence were not the condition), having
g06-096-05|no taste for a sinecure, I have only to thank
g06-096-06|you for the offer & to decline it.
g06-101-00|' I remain, dear Melbourne, faithfully yours, ' ANGLESEY '
g06-101-01|Soon after his return from Europe, Clarence Paget
g06-101-02|had become seriously ill with a supposed abscess
g06-101-03|on the lungs. After months of suffering, his life was
g06-101-04|almost despaired of when as a last resort it was
g06-101-05|suggested that the patient should be taken to consult
g06-101-06|Hahnemann once again.
g06-105-00|It was no longer necessary to go further than Paris,
g06-105-01|for by this time the great man had been driven
g06-105-02|from his native Germany by the antipathy of his
g06-105-03|orthodox brethren. The main difficulty was how to
g06-105-04|make the expedition from England without killing the
g06-105-05|patient before he completed it. The problem was
g06-105-06|overcome in an interesting manner.
g06-109-00|' Fortunately, ' wrote Clarence in after years, ' the
g06-109-01|King... remembered there was a luxurious old bed
g06-109-02|travelling-carriage in the royal coach-houses, which
g06-109-03|had carried his brother, George 4., and he kindly
g06-109-04|placed it at the disposal of my father. Into it I was
g06-109-05|put, more dead than alive, and we got across to
g06-109-06|Calais, and from thence by easy stages to
g06-109-07|Paris...
g06-115-00|He wrote down every symptom, examined me all
g06-115-01|over, asked ever so many questions which I had
g06-115-02|scarcely strength to answer, and took up his gold-
g06-115-03|headed cane to depart. My father hung upon every
g06-115-04|word, but could get nothing from him.
g07-000a-00|WHEN HE SAW TRELAWNY'S PRINTED LETTER,
g07-000a-01|LORD SIDNEY WROTE TO DOUGLAS KINNAIRD
g07-000a-02|SAYING THAT IT WAS INCORRECT THROUGHOUT. HE
g07-000a-03|HAD NO SOONER HEARD FROM COUNT GAMBA AND
g07-000a-04|FLETCHER THAT BYRON WOULD HAVE WISHED
g07-000a-05|HIS BODY TO RETURN TO ENGLAND THAN THAT
g07-000a-06|COURSE WAS ' IMMEDIATELY CARRIED INTO
g07-000a-07|EFFECT ' - NOT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF AND SIR
g07-000a-08|FREDERICK STOVEN, BUT WITH THEIR PERFECT
g07-000a-09|CONCURRENCE, WHILE ' GENERAL ADAM WAS AT
g07-000a-10|CORFU THE WHOLE TIME AND NEVER INTER-
g07-000a-11|FERED IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE ABOUT...
g07-003a-00|HIS ONLY REFERENCE TO TRELAWNY BY NAME IN
g07-003a-01|THE COURSE OF SEVERAL COMMUNICATIONS TO
g07-003a-02|HOBHOUSE AND KINNAIRD ABOUT BYRON'S AFFAIRS
g07-003a-03|IS SATIRICAL: ' I HAVE NOT THE 1HONOR OF ANY
g07-003a-04|ACQUAINTANCE WITH MR TRELAWNY WHO SEEMS TO
g07-003a-05|HAVE HAD CHARGE OF THE MULE WHEN COUNT
g07-003a-06|GAMBA ACCOMPANIED THE REMAINS OF OUR
g07-003a-07|DECEASED FRIEND TO ZANTE..... ' IF TRELAWNY
g07-003a-08|FAILED EVEN TO MEET LORD SIDNEY AND THE
g07-003a-09|BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S OTHER REPRESENTATIVES
g07-003a-10|IN THE ISLANDS, WHILE THEY WARMLY WELCOMED...
g07-003b-00|His only reference to Trelawny by name in the course of several
g07-003b-01|communications to Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron's affairs is
g07-003b-02|satirical: ' I have not the 1honor of any acquaintance with Mr
g07-003b-03|Trelawny who seems to have had charge of the Mule when Count
g07-003b-04|Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante.... '
g07-003b-05|If Trelawny failed even to meet Lord Sidney and the British
g07-003b-06|Government's other representatives in the islands, while they
g07-003b-07|warmly welcomed Gamba to their counsels, it would go far to
g07-003b-08|explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young
g07-003b-09|Italian's expense.
g07-007a-00|IN HIS POPULAR AND ACUTELY UNRELIABLE
g07-007a-01|BOOK ON BYRON AND SHELLEY, TRELAWNY
g07-007a-02|IMPLIES THAT NOT ONLY GAMBA BUT FLETCHER
g07-007a-03|AND TITA AND THE STEWARD, LEGA ZAMBELLI,
g07-007a-04|FAILED TO PERFORM THE MOST ELEMENTARY
g07-007a-05|DUTIES TOWARDS THE DEAD. HE PRETENDS
g07-007a-06|TO HAVE FOUND EVERYTHING IN UTTERMOST
g07-007a-07|DISORDER - ' TOKENS THAT THE PILGRIM
g07-007a-08|HAD MOST TREASURED, SCATTERED ON THE
g07-007a-09|FLOOR, - AS RUBBISH OF NO MARKE-
g07-007a-10|TABLE VALUE, AND TRAMPLED ON '.
g07-007b-00|In his popular and acutely unreliable book on Byron and
g07-007b-01|Shelley, Trelawny implies that not only Gamba but Fletcher
g07-007b-02|and Tita and the steward, Lega Zambelli, failed to perform
g07-007b-03|the most elementary duties towards the dead. He pretends
g07-007b-04|to have found everything in uttermost disorder - ' tokens that
g07-007b-05|the Pilgrim had most treasured, scattered on the floor, -
g07-007b-06|as rubbish of no marketable value, and trampled on '.
g07-010b-00|This was to give colour to his pretext for copying Byron's last
g07-010b-01|letter to his sister, which was that its chance of reaching its
g07-010b-02|destination had seemed slight. The collection of Pietro
g07-010b-03|Gamba's letters deposited among the Murray manuscripts show
g07-010b-04|that the greatest care was observed in gathering together all the possessions
g07-010b-05|of a man whose importance was fully recognized by everyone about
g07-010b-06|him. ' I have had put under Government seal his belongings,
g07-010b-07|which will be opened by Prince Alexander Mavrocordato
g07-010b-08|in my presence and that of certain Englishmen who are
g07-010b-09|here.
g07-014-00|I have taken an exact inventory of them. '
g07-014-01|Thus on April 21st, several days before
g07-014-02|Trelawny appeared, Gamba wrote to Lord
g07-014-03|Sidney Osborne, and his inventory has been
g07-014-04|preserved. The papers were reopened in the
g07-014-05|presence of leading Missolonghi officials
g07-014-06|in order to make sure that no recent will
g07-014-07|was amongst them.
g07-014b-00|I have taken an exact inventory of them. ' Thus on April 21st, several
g07-014b-01|days before Trelawny appeared, Gamba wrote to Lord Sidney Osborne,

g07-014b-03|the presence of leading Missolonghi officials in order to make
g07-014b-04|sure that no recent will was amongst them.
g07-018a-00|It may have been then that Trelawny contrived to do
g07-018a-01|his copying. Considering that Pietro was not above
g07-018a-02|twenty-three years of age when he undertook a load
g07-018a-03|of heavy responsibilities, his conduct reveals him as
g07-018a-04|one of the most intelligent as well as the most
g07-018a-05|sympathetic of Byron's 6entourage in Greece. With
g07-018a-06|his good looks - for he ' carried the passport of a very
g07-018a-07|handsome person ' - his good manners and his perfect
g07-018a-08|lack of pretension, he even succeeded in disarming
g07-018a-09|Hobhouse's possessiveness and making him forget how
g07-018a-10|deeply he had disapproved, less than two years
g07-022a-00|Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed,
g07-022a-01|and wrote to Lady Byron after she had
g07-022a-02|received a visit from him: I have today seen
g07-022a-03|Count Gamba - which was very distressing
g07-022a-04|for many reasons but quite unavoidable - he
g07-022a-05|is a pleasing, fine looking young man &
g07-022a-06|spoke with great feeling. The unfortunate
g07-022a-07|Augusta was in one of her worst states of
g07-022a-08|confusion.
g07-022b-00|Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed, and wrote
g07-022b-01|to Lady Byron after she had received a visit from
g07-022b-02|him: I have today seen Count Gamba - which was very
g07-022b-03|distressing for many reasons but quite unavoidable -

g07-022b-05|with great feeling. The unfortunate Augusta was
g07-022b-06|in one of her worst states of confusion.
g07-026a-00|She had loved Byron, but she had
g07-026a-01|betrayed him, betrayed him not twice, as
g07-026a-02|he had betrayed her, but again and again
g07-026a-03|over a long span of time, fawning on his
g07-026a-04|implacable wife, purveying to her in secret
g07-026a-05|the unguarded letters he never suspected
g07-026a-06|any eye but her own would see, feeding
g07-026a-07|the stealthy fires of her animosity: and
g07-026a-08|having betrayed him, she had grown to fear
g07-026a-09|and almost to hate him.
g07-026b-00|She had loved Byron, but she had betrayed him,

g07-026b-07|and having betrayed him, she had grown to
g07-026b-08|fear and almost to hate him.
g07-028a-00|She had dreaded his outpourings of affection
g07-028a-01|for her in poetry that he thought would clear
g07-028a-02|her and that only compromised her, and the
g07-028a-03|headstrong folly that tempted him to write on
g07-028a-04|ever more daring themes, teaching the world
g07-028a-05|to guess what repentance and unrepentance
g07-028a-06|preyed upon his thoughts.
g07-028b-00|She had dreaded his outpourings of affection for
g07-028b-01|her in poetry that he thought would clear
g07-028b-02|her and that only compromised her, and #
g07-028b-03|the headstrong folly that tempted him to
g07-028b-04|write on ever more daring themes, teaching
g07-028b-05|the world to guess what repentance and
g07-028b-06|unrepentance preyed upon his thoughts.
g07-030-00|She had dreaded still more that he might
g07-030-01|return to England, overshadowing her again
g07-030-02|with spiritual and social peril. But this kind
g07-030-03|of return was what she could never have
g07-030-04|foreseen... that he # should come back not
g07-030-05|voluble but silent, not beautiful but defaced,
g07-030-06|not in obloquy but with his praises ringing!
g07-030-07|She could remember now his exciting laughter,
g07-030-08|his almost filial love for her, her almost
g07-030-09|maternal love for him.
g07-034-00|Above all she could remember the anguish of their
g07-034-01|parting, and how he had been ' convulsed, absolutely
g07-034-02|convulsed with grief '. So love revived, and in
g07-034-03|its most sentimental form. While he lived
g07-034-04|she had lost touch in her perpetual alarms
g07-034-05|with what was best in him; dead his memory
g07-034-06|became sacred to her.
g07-038-00|She felt almost as strongly as Hobhouse
g07-038-01|# about biographies. Quite apart from the
g07-038-02|divagations of her ' poor brother ' - so she
g07-038-03|constantly referred to him - there were a
g07-038-04|hundred reasons why it would be
g07-038-05|objectionable to have the family history
g07-038-06|exposed. Whatever latitude she allowed in
g07-038-07|the warmth of her kindly nature to others -
g07-038-08|or to herself - she believed implicitly in
g07-038-09|the moral code she had learned from
g07-038-10|her good grandmother, the Countess of
g07-042-00|She had no desire to see in print that her
g07-042-01|mother, who was to have been a duchess, had
g07-042-02|been involved in a scandalous and ruinous
g07-042-03|divorce, that her father, ' Mad Jack Byron ', was
g07-042-04|a profligate and a bankrupt who had
g07-042-05|squandered every penny two successive wives
g07-042-06|had brought him and left the second on
g07-042-07|the verge of destitution, and that he had died
g07-042-08|a drunkard and perhaps a suicide, hiding
g07-042-09|in France to escape his creditors.
g07-044-00|It was no more pleasant for the Hon. Augusta
g07-044-01|Leigh to share this kind of story with the world
g07-044-02|than it would be for most 20th-century ladies
g07-044-03|moving in court circles and having children to
g07-044-04|be settled advantageously in life. She had lived
g07-044-05|down the rumours which had made the year of
g07-044-06|the Byron separation a nightmare to her, and she
g07-044-07|had also succeeded, though with an increasing
g07-044-08|sense of effort, in persuading her little world to
g07-044-09|avert its eyes from her husband, ' that drone ',
g07-044-10|as # Byron called him, whose career of
g07-047-00|She had earned the right to be left in peace.
g07-047-01|Byron's fame was, of course, very wonderful, but
g07-047-02|it carried with it too many reminders of his
g07-047-03|terrible indiscretions - the writing of Don Juan,
g07-047-04|which she had never ceased to deplore, his
g07-047-05|shocking blasphemies like the Vision of Judgement,
g07-047-06|his making friends with the atheist known to
g07-047-07|her as ' that infamous Mr. Shelley ', and his
g07-047-08|mixing with really low and horrid people such
g07-047-09|as the subversive journalist Leigh Hunt, whom
g07-047-10|on would never conceivably meet in decent society.
g07-050-00|She was most emphatically opposed to the
g07-050-01|production of sheer indelicacies, and that was
g07-050-02|the light in which she saw the proposed book
g07-050-03|by Dallas. Letters between a mother and a son -
g07-050-04|a son so outspoken and a mother so far from
g07-050-05|suitable to be paraded before the public!
g07-050-06|And brought out by that seedy poor relation,
g07-050-07|Dallas! Could anything be in worse taste?
g07-065-00|Hanson, the solicitor, was naturally remunerated
g07-065-01|for his services, but all Mr Hobhouse's duties
g07-065-02|as executor were performed without reward.
g07-065-03|And now there was more trouble brewing
g07-065-04|with those unbearable Dallases. Dallas
g07-065-05|senior was detained in Paris by severe
g07-065-06|illness, but Dallas junior was full of
g07-065-07|fight and applying for the injunction
g07-065-08|to be lifted.
g07-069a-00|He had gone to Byron's cousin, now 7th
g07-069a-01|lord, and had got him to compose an
g07-069a-02|affidavit to the effect that, whereas he
g07-069a-03|had formerly been reluctant to approve the
g07-069a-04|publication unless it had first been
g07-069a-05|examined by the relatives and friends of
g07-069a-06|his predecessor, he had now read the
g07-069a-07|book and was content for it to be
g07-069a-08|issued without that precaution.
g07-071a-00|There were few things in Augusta's whole
g07-071a-01|life, full of calamities though it was, that
g07-071a-02|hurt her more than this contemptuous slight
g07-071a-03|from George Anson Byron, whom she had
g07-071a-04|loved with an unswerving loyalty, and had looked
g07-071a-05|on as her intimate friend. Moreover, he
g07-071a-06|was without the right to make such
g07-071a-07|pronouncements: he had inherited nothing
g07-071a-08|from her brother but his title, whereas
g07-071a-09|she was not only of nearer consanguinity
g07-071a-10|but the chosen recipient of his property.
g07-074a-00|These, if she had only known it, were
g07-074a-01|precisely the reasons why her cousin took
g07-074a-02|pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her.
g07-074a-03|Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have
g07-074a-04|intimate friends, and in every instance where
g07-074a-05|the occasion was granted her, she managed
g07-074a-06|to find some excuse for bestowing, in whole
g07-074a-07|or in part, those confidences which never
g07-074a-08|failed to leave her audience agape with
g07-074a-09|wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta's
g07-074a-10|wickedness.
g07-077a-00|George Anson Byron had seen enough of
g07-077a-01|the poet's atrocious conduct as a husband
g07-077a-02|to be aware that Augusta, so far from
g07-077a-03|being responsible for the collapse of the
g07-077a-04|marriage, had been Lady Byron's greatest
g07-077a-05|support and comfort at the time; but it
g07-077a-06|had been deemed necessary all the
g07-077a-07|same to enlighten him as to the suspicions
g07-077a-08|in the background, and he had repeated
g07-077a-09|them to his newly married wife.
g07-084-00|' Respecting the will ', he wrote to Byron's widow a few days after
g07-084-01|hearing its contents, ' the very thought of it is painful to me.
g07-084-02|What Mary has said about it is too true. ' What Mary, the
g07-084-03|new Lady Byron, had said about it was written on the first half
g07-084-04|sheet of the same paper: My dearest Annabella, The more we
g07-084-05|consider the most prominent subject in your letter, the more
g07-084-06|we are convinced of the truth of that dreadful history
g07-084-07|connected with it.
h01-000-00|Questions about marriage and children were
h01-000-01|again included, as they had been at the
h01-000-02|1911 and 1951 Censuses. The former had asked
h01-000-03|for marriage details for all married women,
h01-000-04|the latter for all married women under
h01-000-05|the age of 50. The 1961 Census questions
h01-000-06|related to all women who were or had been
h01-000-07|married, and so repeated the enquiry made
h01-000-08|fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family
h01-000-09|Census conducted on behalf of the Royal
h01-000-10|Commission on Population.
h01-007-00|The innovation at the 1961 Census, though the
h01-007-01|Family Census had previously included
h01-007-02|the question, was the date of termination
h01-007-03|of the first or only marriage. This enables
h01-007-04|statistical use to be made of their experience
h01-007-05|as regards duration of marriage and
h01-007-06|number of children in the case of women
h01-007-07|whose first or only marriage was terminated
h01-007-08|by widowhood or divorce after the end
h01-007-09|of their child bearing life.
h01-010-00|This is particularly important in estimating the trends
h01-010-01|in the size and pattern of families for successive
h01-010-02|generations over as long a period as possible, as the
h01-010-03|proportion of widows predominates in the higher age
h01-010-04|groups. In Wales and Monmouthshire the question
h01-010-05|on the ability to speak Welsh was included as
h01-010-06|previously. The question was first asked in 1891, and
h01-010-07|was given its present form in 1931.
h01-014-00|Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions
h01-014-01|about housing and households. In 1961 the scope of the
h01-014-02|question was wider than before, because of the great
h01-014-03|use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local
h01-014-04|Government and to local authorities. As before, the record
h01-014-05|made during the enumeration lists all buildings, residen-
h01-014-06|tial premises and temporary places of abode, and all
h01-014-07|households occupying them, as the basis of the
h01-014-08|enumeration is the household schedule.
h01-018-00|The number of structurally separate dwellings ( that is,
h01-018-01|houses or flats or other quarters built or adapted for
h01-018-02|separate occupation and forming a private and structurally
h01-018-03|separate unit) was obtained as previously, together with the
h01-018-04|number of households with sole occupation or sharing
h01-018-05|such dwellings, and the number of living rooms occu-
h01-018-06|pied by each household.
h01-024-00|A new question asked about housing tenure, whether
h01-024-01|the accommodation occupied by each household was held by
h01-024-02|them as owner-occupiers; occupied in connection with
h01-024-03|employment or as part of business premises; rented
h01-024-04|from a Council ( or New Town Corporation) or a private
h01-024-05|landlord ( if so, whether furnished or unfurnished); or
h01-024-06|occupied on some other terms. The analysis of private
h01-024-07|households by size and various characteristics of their
h01-024-08|members has become increasingly important.
h01-027-00|Previously, while visitors were left out of this
h01-027-01|analysis it was not considered sufficiently
h01-027-02|important to attempt the task of bringing
h01-027-03|in the members away from home on Census
h01-027-04|night, which would be very laborious in the
h01-027-05|absence of information given at their place
h01-027-06|of usual residence ( n log n). But the need
h01-027-07|for a more accurate distribution of
h01-027-08|households by size as usually constituted
h01-027-09|had become more important by 1961, and
h01-027-10|accordingly a new question was introduced,...
h01-030-00|The information collected under
h01-030-01|this head will not affect the
h01-030-02|main count of population numbers,
h01-030-03|but will be used solely in the
h01-030-04|analysis of households by size
h01-030-05|and other characteristics. Sample. -
h01-030-06|At an early stage of the census
h01-030-07|preparations consideration was
h01-030-08|given to possibilities of reducing
h01-030-09|the amount of clerical work before...
h02-004-00|We have held eleven meetings. We decided as a
h02-004-01|first step to seek information from a number
h02-004-02|of organisations and persons having an interest
h02-004-03|in the questions before us and at a later stage we
h02-004-04|arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
h02-004-05|anybody interested to submit representations. We
h02-004-06|compiled a list of the points which we thought
h02-004-07|were of importance, but we made it clear that
h02-004-08|the replies need not be confined to these
h02-004-09|particular items.
h02-008-00|As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence, though
h02-008-01|we found it an advantage in certain instances. Appendix
h02-008-02|1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted. The
h02-008-03|Department of Health for Scotland, the Home Office and
h02-008-04|the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us;
h02-008-05|officers of these Departments attended our meetings
h02-008-06|and have given us valuable assistance.
h02-012-00|On 23rd November, 1959, we submitted
h02-012-01|an Interim Report. This dealt with two questions
h02-012-02|which arose from our terms of reference and
h02-012-03|which had been brought specially to our notice.
h02-012-04|First, we were asked to examine the risks
h02-012-05|attending the abuse of carbromal and
h02-012-06|bromvaletone and preparations containing these
h02-012-07|substances. The Poisons Board had already
h02-012-08|considered this problem but, in the absence of
h02-012-09|sufficient evidence that these compounds
h02-017-00|4. On examination of the evidence it became clear
h02-017-01|to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples
h02-017-02|of a number of drugs on sale to the public which
h02-017-03|were not appropriate for restriction to supply on
h02-017-04|prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951,
h02-017-05|or the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1956, and had
h02-017-06|not so far been recommended for control as
h02-017-07|poisons.
h02-019-00|5. We recommended that, in general, any drug or
h02-019-01|pharmaceutical preparation which has an action on the
h02-019-02|central nervous system and is liable to produce physical
h02-019-03|or psychological deterioration should be confined to supply
h02-019-04|on prescription and that an independent expert body
h02-019-05|should be responsible for advising which substances
h02-019-06|should be so controlled. 6. As an interim and urgent
h02-019-07|measure, the Secretary of State for the Home Department,
h02-019-08|on the recommendation of the Poisons Board, has
h02-022-00|We are glad to note the action that has been taken
h02-022-01|and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure
h02-022-02|that, as other preparations affecting the central nervous
h02-022-03|system become available, they too will be brought to
h02-022-04|the notice of the Poisons Board, or such other advisory
h02-022-05|body as may in due course be appointed for the
h02-022-06|purpose, to consider whether there are sufficient
h02-022-07|grounds for restricting any of them also to supply
h02-022-08|on prescription.
h02-024-00|8. The second part of our Interim Report was
h02-024-01|devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted
h02-024-02|to the gases and vapours which they use in the
h02-024-03|course of their professional duties. We
h02-024-04|ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-
h02-024-05|ity was very small indeed. However, over a
h02-024-06|period of eleven years, patients' lives had been
h02-024-07|endangered in two known instances.
h02-028-00|We were assured by our expert witnesses on this
h02-028-01|subject that, with the apparatus at present to hand, the
h02-028-02|preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before
h02-028-03|administering them to a patient was a recognised and
h02-028-04|necessary precaution. We accepted this. 10. In view of
h02-028-05|the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
h02-028-06|anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
h02-028-07|to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be
h02-028-08|entrusted with their administration.
h02-035-00|The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee, whose advice
h02-035-01|we were invited to review, were to advise on: ( a) the
h02-035-02|circumstances, if any, in which the supply of morphine
h02-035-03|and heroin, and preparations containing these substances,
h02-035-04|to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded
h02-035-05|as medically advisable; ( b) the precautions which medical
h02-035-06|practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or
h02-035-07|heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
h02-035-08|administrative measures that seemed expedient to
h02-035-09|secure observance of those precautions.
h02-037-00|12. Through the system of records and
h02-037-01|inspection then in operation cases were
h02-037-02|brought to the notice of the Home Office
h02-037-03|at that time in which exceptionally
h02-037-04|large quantities of morphine and heroin
h02-037-05|had been supplied to particular practi-
h02-037-06|tioners or prescribed for individual
h02-037-07|cases. On further enquiry it was
h02-037-08|ascertained that sometimes the
h02-037-09|doctor had ordered these drugs simply
h02-040-00|13. It appeared then that in some circumstances
h02-040-01|dangerous drugs were being supplied in
h02-040-02|contravention of the intention of Parliament
h02-040-03|that a doctor should be authorised to supply
h02-040-04|drugs only so far as was necessary for the
h02-040-05|practice of his profession. Before deciding on
h02-040-06|measures to secure proper observance of
h02-040-07|the law, it was felt necessary to have
h02-040-08|some authoritative medical advice on various
h02-040-09|aspects of the treatment of addiction,...
h02-043-00|The Rolleston Committee's recommen-
h02-043-01|dations in 1926 on the supply of morphine
h02-043-02|and heroin to addicts to these drugs and
h02-043-03|on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed
h02-043-04|later in this Report. They have, up to now,
h02-043-05|been included in the Memorandum on
h02-043-06|the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations
h02-043-07|which is prepared by the Home Office
h02-043-08|for the information of doctors and
h02-043-09|dentists.
h02-049-00|The Secretary of State was empowered, on the recommendation of a
h02-049-01|tribunal, to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply
h02-049-02|dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor, or a doctor
h02-049-03|convicted of an offence under the Act, should not issue
h02-049-04|prescriptions for dangerous drugs. ( 3) It was made clear
h02-049-05|that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified
h02-049-06|medical practitioner when required for purposes of
h02-049-07|medical treatment.
h04-028-00|The price ranges for milk,
h04-028-01|cheese, sugar, bread and flour
h04-028-02|were very narrow. For most other
h04-028-03|foods younger childless couples paid
h04-028-04|the highest average prices and
h04-028-05|large families the lowest, the price
h04-028-06|gradients being steepest for
h04-028-07|carcase meat ( +7 to -7 per cent),
h04-028-08|" other" fish ( +8 to -11)," other" vegetables
h04-028-09|( +9 to -9) and beverages other than
h04-028-10|tea ( +12 to -16).
h04-035-00|Consumption by younger childless couples declined
h04-035-01|throughout this period, but that of the smaller families was
h04-035-02|maintained except for the slight fall in 1959. In the largest
h04-035-03|families, particularly those containing four or more children,
h04-035-04|there was a tendency for consumption to increase between 1955 and
h04-035-05|1957, and thereafter to decline. Graduated scales of family
h04-035-06|allowances were introduced in October 1956, and the welfare
h04-035-07|milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957.
h04-049-00|75. The smaller families and the residual groups of
h04-049-01|households containing children reduced their consumption
h04-049-02|of sugar and of preserves, but in all other types of
h04-049-03|household a decline in purchases of the one was
h04-049-04|accompanied by an increase in consumption of the other.
h04-049-05|76. Most groups spent slightly less on potatoes than in
h04-049-06|the previous year, but consumption was maintained
h04-049-07|except in families with more than one child and in
h04-049-08|the unclassified households with children or
h04-049-09|adolescents.
h04-052-00|All groups except families with four or more children
h04-052-01|or with adolescents but no children consumed more fresh green
h04-052-02|vegetables, especially in the first half of the year, although most
h04-052-03|reduced their consumption of other vegetables. Purchases of
h04-052-04|quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased, but extreme-
h04-052-05|ly wide group differences persisted, the averages ranging from
h04-052-06|0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more
h04-052-07|children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult
h04-052-08|households; average consumption by older couples and other
h04-052-09|wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head per week.
h04-055-00|The two latter groups consumed much smaller
h04-055-01|quantities per head of canned vegetables and canned and
h04-055-02|bottled tomatoes than any other group, and much smaller
h04-055-03|quantities of canned and bottled fruit than younger
h04-055-04|childless couples; in households containing children,
h04-055-05|consumption of canned fruit fell off sharply with
h04-055-06|increasing family size, but there was no regular
h04-055-07|gradation in purchases of canned vegetables and canned
h04-055-08|tomatoes.
h04-057-00|All types of household benefited from the improved
h04-057-01|supplies and lower prices of fresh fruit compared
h04-057-02|with 1958, but the increase in consumption was
h04-057-03|least in families containing children. 77. Total
h04-057-04|bread consumption was virtually unchanged,
h04-057-05|although most types of household bought less
h04-057-06|white bread and more rolls and speciality
h04-057-07|breads than in 1958. Most groups increased
h04-057-08|their purchases of puddings, cakes and biscuits,
h04-057-09|but obtained less flour.
h04-061-00|78. Regression estimates of the expenditure on
h04-061-01|different commodities attributable to the adult
h04-061-02|couple and each additional child in a selected
h04-061-03|group of households consisting of childless couples
h04-061-04|( both under 55) and couples with different numbers
h04-061-05|of children were given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of
h04-061-06|the Annual Report for 1956. The younger childless
h04-061-07|couples are broadly comparable in age and family
h04-061-08|income with the family households, so that differences
h04-061-09|in food expenditure may be associated with the
h04-061-10|presence of children.
h04-071-00|The relative expenditure per child declined from 1952 to 1956,
h04-071-01|but rose in 1957 when the subsidy on welfare and national dried
h04-071-02|milk was reduced; since 1957 it has again declined. Most of the
h04-071-03|average expenditure associated with a child was on cereal foods,
h04-071-04|potatoes and milk; for fresh green vegetables, fruit, cheese, fish and
h04-071-05|carcase meat, the incremental expenditure was slight.
h04-074-00|79. Table 30 shows the energy value and nutrient content of
h04-074-01|the diets of households of different composition. The averages
h04-074-02|showed little change compared with those for the previous year,
h04-074-03|except for generally increased intakes of vitamins C and D.
h04-074-04|Since physiological requirements vary widely with age, sex
h04-074-05|and level of activity, comparisons between families of different
h04-074-06|composition are only apposite when considered in relation
h04-074-07|to needs.
h04-078-00|80. Estimates of the adequacy of the diets, assessed by
h04-078-01|comparison with allowances based on the recommendations
h04-078-02|of the British Medical Association, are also shown in Table 30.
h04-078-03|In comparison with the previous year, changes were small
h04-078-04|except for higher estimates for vitamin C. In families with
h04-078-05|four or more children the levels of adequacy for all
h04-078-06|nutrients other than vitamin C decreased slightly.
h04-082-00|For this fairly small group, comparisons between different
h04-082-01|years cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a
h04-082-02|defined number of children. In 1959 the households in
h04-082-03|this group contained slightly more children ( average 4.64)
h04-082-04|than in the previous year ( average 4.53). Their total food
h04-082-05|expenditure increased less than that in other groups,
h04-082-06|and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish,
h04-082-07|poultry, eggs, canned vegetables, fresh fruit, chocolate
h04-082-08|biscuits and breakfast cereals which, in general, are more
h04-082-09|expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which
h04-082-10|they purchased less, namely dried milk, potatoes, carcase
h04-082-11|meat, sugar, bread, flour and oatmeal and oat products.
h06-000-00|To provide fuller information about certain types of
h06-000-01|dangerous occurrence, Section 65 of the Factories Act,
h06-000-02|1937, requires notification of certain specified
h06-000-03|occurrences to H.M. District Inspectors of Factories,
h06-000-04|whether or not they result in injury. Appendix 20
h06-000-05|gives figures of dangerous occurrences reported in
h06-000-06|1960; the types of occurrence which have to be
h06-000-07|reported are set out in the heading to the Appendix.
h06-003-00|The total number of dangerous occurrences reported
h06-003-01|during the year was 1,409, an increase of 111 over
h06-003-02|the total for 1959. However, the number of
h06-003-03|notifiable accidents associated with occurrences fell
h06-003-04|from 252 ( 31 of them fatal) in 1959 to
h06-003-05|245 ( 22 fatal) in 1960. The main increase in
h06-003-06|the numbers of occurrences reported occurred in the
h06-003-07|category of those due to the collapse or
h06-003-08|failure of a crane, derrick, winch or hoist, where
h06-003-09|there was an increase of almost one-third from
h06-003-10|335 to 438.
h06-079-00|The equipment takes two forms - an insulating
h06-079-01|guard on the jib of the crane, intended to
h06-079-02|prevent direct contact with the line, and
h06-079-03|electronic equipment with a sensitive probe
h06-079-04|mounted slightly forward of the head of the
h06-079-05|jib and with electronic assembly
h06-079-06|and warning apparatus in the driver's
h06-079-07|cab. Improved designs of both forms
h06-079-08|are being tried out at present.
h06-082-00|There is, however, a danger that workers
h06-082-01|will rely too much on fixed devices because
h06-082-02|they fail to recognise their limitations.
h06-082-03|It is therefore safer both in principle and
h06-082-04|practice to keep the worker away from
h06-082-05|overhead lines wherever possible, e.g., by
h06-082-06|( 1) re-routing the line, ( 2) putting the supply
h06-082-07|underground, ( 3) making the line
h06-082-08|dead ( after consultation with the supply
h06-082-09|authority), ( 4) providing barriers at a safe
h06-082-10|distance to prevent vehicles from approaching
h06-085-00|It is also important to remember that on
h06-085-01|lines carrying the higher voltages flashover
h06-085-02|from the line may take place without
h06-085-03|actual contact. A new type of
h06-085-04|machine has recently been developed for
h06-085-05|the automatic rolling of sole leather
h06-085-06|bends. The sheet of leather is placed
h06-085-07|on a sliding feed tray outside the
h06-085-08|danger zone and is then pushed
h06-085-09|forward between two platens, the upper
h06-085-10|one carrying a set of small rollers.
h06-089-00|The lower platen, which supports the
h06-089-01|leather, is raised hydraulically to bring
h06-089-02|it into contact with the rollers on the upper
h06-089-03|platen, which is then caused to make
h06-089-04|several horizontal oscillations so that the
h06-089-05|leather is rolled and pressed at the same time.
h06-089-06|The danger zone between the platens is fenced
h06-089-07|by a guard which is interlocked with the
h06-089-08|hydraulic valve and the press is also
h06-089-09|sequentially operated: the closing of the shutter
h06-089-10|starts the machine, the rest of the cycle
h06-089-11|following automatically.
h06-092-00|A new method of applying sand to the
h06-092-01|faces of green bricks has recently been
h06-092-02|developed. In the case of wire-cut bricks
h06-092-03|the column of clay from the pug-mill is
h06-092-04|carried by a short length of belt
h06-092-05|conveyor to the sanding plant.
h06-092-06|This consists basically of a vibrating
h06-092-07|hopper from which the sand is
h06-092-08|distributed to all four faces by a
h06-092-09|system of slots, scrapers and worms.
h06-096-00|The conveyor is broken at this point to
h06-096-01|enable the sand to be applied to
h06-096-02|the under surface of the column, which
h06-096-03|passes on through two pairs of
h06-096-04|vibrating rollers which embed the sand
h06-096-05|firmly in the surfaces and is finally
h06-096-06|cut into bricks at the wire cutting
h06-096-07|table.
h07-000-00|Of over 7,000,000 square feet of factory space built by the
h07-000-01|development corporations, about 20 per cent represents
h07-000-02|extensions built after the firms had become established.
h07-000-03|It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-
h07-000-04|rents or ground rents for their factories or industrial
h07-000-05|sites; and rents vary considerably according to the demand
h07-000-06|for factory accommodation.
h07-003-00|The average gross return on established industrial estates
h07-003-01|ranges from 7 to 9 per cent of the capital expenditure on land,
h07-003-02|site works and buildings. Manufacturing industry affords
h07-003-03|employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as
h07-003-04|manual workers. An analysis made by Crawley Development
h07-003-05|Corporation in 1958, after collating replies from fifty-eight
h07-003-06|manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff,
h07-003-07|showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as
h07-003-08|managerial and administrative, 11 per cent as technical
h07-003-09|or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical.
h07-007-00|There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to
h07-007-01|Crawley. The development corporations have aimed at a varied
h07-007-02|pattern of industry, offering a reasonable choice of
h07-007-03|employer as well as choice of occupation for men, women and
h07-007-04|school-leavers, with due regard to the industries
h07-007-05|already established in their towns. Inevitably engineering,
h07-007-06|including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries,
h07-007-07|predominates in all the London new towns since these are
h07-007-08|among the industries which have expanded most
h07-007-09|during the last ten years in the country generally.
h07-011-00|Of those at present employed in manufacturing industry
h07-011-01|in the eight London new towns about 40 per cent are
h07-011-02|employed in engineering and electrical goods manufacture -
h07-011-03|the proportion employed in both these groups combined
h07-011-04|varies from about 30 per cent in Welwyn to 85 per cent in
h07-011-05|Stevenage and 90 per cent in Hatfield.
h07-013-00|These figures are much higher than the national
h07-013-01|averages, and may be thought to indicate a
h07-013-02|lack of balance in some of the towns. On the other
h07-013-03|hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of
h07-013-04|skilled employment and are highly diversified
h07-013-05|as regards products, markets and methods of
h07-013-06|manufacture. Consumer goods industries such as the
h07-013-07|manufacture of food # and drink, tobacco, clothing
h07-013-08|and footwear are under-represented in the new
h07-013-09|towns generally though not in Basildon and
h07-013-10|Welwyn.
h07-017-00|The following table indicates the size of the
h07-017-01|firms, some of them occupying more than
h07-017-02|one factory, introduced or sponsored by
h07-017-03|development corporations in the new towns: The
h07-017-04|overall average for the factories sponsored by
h07-017-05|development corporations is about 170 employees
h07-017-06|per firm, and the average for each of the London
h07-017-07|new towns is roughly the same except at Hatfield,
h07-017-08|where it is much lower, and Stevenage, where it
h07-017-09|is much higher.
h07-020-00|The position at Stevenage is accounted for by
h07-020-01|the presence of one firm with 3,700 employees
h07-020-02|and two others with over 1,000 employees.
h07-020-03|About 32 per cent of all the workers employed
h07-020-04|in factories sponsored by the development
h07-020-05|corporations are employed by the eleven
h07-020-06|largest firms and about 23 per cent by the next
h07-020-07|group of firms employing between five
h07-020-08|hundred and one thousand workers.

h07-023-01|development corporations the proportion of
h07-023-02|female employees, expressed as a percentage
h07-023-03|of all employees, varies from 23 per cent in
h07-023-04|Welwyn Garden City and 24 per cent in
h07-023-05|Hemel Hempstead to 35 per cent in
h07-023-06|Basildon and 55 per cent in Hatfield
h07-023-07|with an average of about 30 per cent

h07-054a-00|Except at Hemel Hempstead, large office
h07-054a-01|organisations have until quite recently shown
h07-054a-02|little interest in the new towns, probably because of
h07-054a-03|the difficulty in the early years in recruiting
h07-054a-04|suitable staff, especially junior staff, locally.
h07-054a-05|There is evidence of greater interest today,

h07-054a-07|office space under construction - almost as
h07-054a-08|much as the total area so far completed.
h07-057a-00|This interest is likely to grow as employers become
h07-057a-01|aware of the advantages of setting up offices in towns
h07-057a-02|with a young and growing population and excellent
h07-057a-03|schools and technical colleges. Towards the end of

h07-084-00|Londoners not in housing need, # but whose departure
h07-084-01|from London may be assumed to release accommodation
h07-084-02|there, are recruited for jobs which cannot be filled through

h07-084-04|resort are people from outside London allotted new town
h07-084-05|houses. As a result, almost 80 per cent of the #
h07-084-06|houses let by the development # corporations in the

h07-087-00|Tables C, D and E of Appendix 16 give details of

j01-042-00|Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given
j01-042-01|material in the sodium coolant circuit will start to
j01-042-02|oxidise the cell can only be used as has been
j01-042-03|suggested above, as an oxygen concentration monitor.
j01-042-04|However, if a material oxidizes in sodium at a given
j01-042-05|oxygen potential the reference electrode could be held
j01-042-06|at that potential and oxidizing or reducing conditions
j01-042-07|in the coolant circuit for that material would be
j01-042-08|indicated by a negative or positive potential at the
j01-042-09|reference electrode.
j01-045-00|Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium
j01-045-01|circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference
j01-045-02|electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated
j01-045-03|with niobium separated from the coolant by a
j01-045-04|solid anionic electrolyte. A negative voltage from
j01-045-05|the reference electrode would mean oxidizing
j01-045-06|conditions for niobium and positive voltage, non-
j01-045-07|oxidizing conditions. The practical application of
j01-045-08|the above idea will involve considerable experimenta-
j01-045-09|tion before it can be realised.
j01-049-00|The first requirement is for an anionic
j01-049-01|electrolyte, which can be fabricated into
j01-049-02|suitable shapes impervious to gases and
j01-049-03|liquid sodium and which is neither
j01-049-04|corroded by sodium nor by sodium
j01-049-05|monoxide. Possible materials are zirconia
j01-049-06|stabilised with lime and thoria doped
j01-049-07|with rare earth oxides.
j01-059-00|Provided the temperatures at C and E are
j01-059-01|the same, thermoelectric contributions to the
j01-059-02|voltage should be zero. The probe extends
j01-059-03|out of the sodium stream through a close
j01-059-04|fitting thin walled T-Junction F and passes
j01-059-05|into the open via a water-cooled O ring seal G.
j01-059-06|The open end of the probe is sealed with
j01-059-07|a vacuum coupling H which also positions
j01-059-08|the +ve nickel conductor with respect
j01-059-09|to the sodium by circlips on either side
j01-059-10|of the seal I.
j01-063-00|Evaporation of sodium from the pool C is
j01-063-01|minimised by a close fitting cylindrical
j01-063-02|block of electrolyte J attached to the +ve nickel
j01-063-03|conductor by nickel circlips. Fixing and
j01-063-04|positioning of the probe relative to the coolant
j01-063-05|stream is effected by tie-bars of insulating
j01-063-06|material K joining the vacuum coupling H to the
j01-063-07|water cooled flange G.
j01-066-00|The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas
j01-066-01|via the tube L which must of course be electrically
j01-066-02|isolated after this has been carried out. It is not
j01-066-03|suggested that the above proposal will be successful
j01-066-04|but rather that it is worth a trial in the event of
j01-066-05|the inadequacy of some simpler method of
j01-066-06|monitoring the oxygen in a sodium circuit. The
j01-066-07|principal difficulty encountered by the author, in
j01-066-08|determining partial molal free energies by solid
j01-066-09|electrolyte cells of very stable oxides such as UO2,
j01-066-10|MnO etc. was vapour phase transfer of oxygen by
j01-066-11|carbonaceous impurities in the blanket gas.
j01-070-00|This resulted in the oxidation of the
j01-070-01|-ve electrode and reduction of the +ve
j01-070-02|electrode which of course led to a loss in
j01-070-03|E.M.F. from the cell. In the above design the two
j01-070-04|electrodes are completely separated from one
j01-070-05|another so that this major source of
j01-070-06|trouble should not be present.
j04-008-00|The presence of 75 of bismuth-210 is equivalent to
j04-008-01|ingrowth over two half-lives ( ten days). Therefore
j04-008-02|after a further forty days, the bismuth daughter
j04-008-03|will be within 0.1 sources are required for use sooner
j04-008-04|than forty or fifty days after preparation, the
j04-008-05|lead-210 together with added lead carrier must
j04-008-06|be separated from the bismuth-210 daughter by
j04-008-07|ion exchange ( see Analytical Method, steps 4, 5)
j04-008-08|before precipitating lead chromate.
j04-012-00|Knowing the time of separation and the
j04-012-01|activity of the lead-210 solution, the ingrowth
j04-012-02|of the bismuth-210 can be calculated. The
j04-012-03|absolute activity of the reference standards
j04-012-04|can be calculated from the known activity
j04-012-05|of the lead-210 solution and the chemical
j04-012-06|yield, but this calculation is unnecessary
j04-012-07|provided the same lead carrier solution is
j04-012-08|used to prepare the reference standards
j04-012-09|and for the analyses.
j04-015-00|Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate
j04-015-01|precipitates need be known because the concentration
j04-015-02|of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the
j04-015-03|algebraic equations. An effort was made to
j04-015-04|detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in
j04-015-05|the tracer by separating the lead-210 and the
j04-015-06|bismuth-210 by anion exchange. The 15b-counting
j04-015-07|of the lead-210 fraction began within a few
j04-015-08|minutes of completing the separation.
j04-019-00|The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed
j04-019-01|for ten days and showed no abnormalities.
j04-019-02|Any impurity in the lead fraction must ha-
j04-019-03|ve been well below one percent. Some separa-
j04-019-04|ted lead-210 was used to make reference stan-
j04-019-05|dards and as a tracer in recovery experiments.
j04-019-06|There was no significant difference between the-
j04-019-07|se results and those obtained using the original
j04-019-08|lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical
j04-019-09|Centre which we concluded was radiochemi-
j04-019-10|cally pure.
j04-024-00|Rosenquist ( 4) showed that minute quantities of
j04-024-01|lead can be isolated from large volumes of solu-
j04-024-02|tion by coprecipitating the lead with a strontium
j04-024-03|sulphate. Lead and strontium form mixed cry-
j04-024-04|stals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate
j04-024-05|is almost completely recovered even if precipitation
j04-024-06|of the strontium sulphate is incomplete. Using
j04-024-07|ten milligrams of lead carrier and six
j04-024-08|hundred milligrams of strontium per liter,
j04-024-09|more than 95 experiment.
j04-035-00|Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a
j04-035-01|minimum but the accuracy and precision of
j04-035-02|weighing the precipitated sources suffers. All
j04-035-03|precipitates were weighed on a semi-micro balance
j04-035-04|which had been calibrated with a set of certificated
j04-035-05|weights from the National Physical Laboratory.
j04-035-06|Complete chemical exchange between the
j04-035-07|radio-lead and the added lead carrier is
j04-035-08|necessary if the analytical results are to
j04-035-09|be correct.
j04-039-00|In the preliminary experiments, the tracer was added to a
j04-039-01|liter of effluent and immediately coprecipitated with
j04-039-02|strontium sulphate from hot solution. Chemical exchange
j04-039-03|was complete under these conditions; but when the tracer
j04-039-04|was added to alkaline effluent and allowed to
j04-039-05|stand for several days before the addition of lead
j04-039-06|carrier, the recovery of lead-210 was as much as five
j04-039-07|per cent low when corrected for gravimetric recovery
j04-039-08|of the carrier.
j04-046-00|The presence and growth of algae in the
j04-046-01|alkaline effluent does not prevent the
j04-046-02|recovery of radio-lead under the prescribed
j04-046-03|conditions although some radioactivity remains
j04-046-04|on the algae until the metathesis has been
j04-046-05|completed by heating the mixed sulphates
j04-046-06|with three separate portions of dilute ( 1.25
j04-046-07|normal) sodium carbonate solution. The
j04-046-08|strength of the carbonate solution was
j04-046-09|chosen after experiments with lead tracer
j04-046-10|alone which indicated that less lead was
j04-053-00|A small manual coffee grinder is useful as the resin
j04-053-01|cannot be ground with a mortar and pestle. The
j04-053-02|sieved resin is washed repeatedly with distilled water
j04-053-03|to remove fines and then with hydrochloric acid to
j04-053-04|convert the resin completely to the chloride form.
j04-053-05|The 60-100 mesh resin is again washed with water to
j04-053-06|remove the acid and finally dried in air.
j04-061-00|The glass tube is 11 cm. long and 1 cm. in internal
j04-061-01|diameter. One end of the tube is drawn down to a fine
j04-061-02|tip and a B14 conical glass socket is fitted to the
j04-061-03|other end as shown in Figure 1. The reservoir is a 50 ml
j04-061-04|cylindrical separating funnel with a capillary tap
j04-061-05|modified by the addition of a B14 cone to fit the
j04-061-06|glass column.
j04-065-00|The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by
j04-065-01|experiment for each batch of resin using radioactive tracer
j04-065-02|( lead-210, bismuth-210). A typical elution curve is shown in
j04-065-03|Figure 3. Once these volumes have been established, the weight
j04-065-04|of resin used is also fixed. All available evidence indicates
j04-065-05|that the fractions containing lead and bismuth are free
j04-065-06|of cross contamination apart from the natural
j04-065-07|ingrowth of the daughters arising from the decay of
j04-065-08|lead.
j04-070-00|Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not
j04-070-01|interfere. Strontium does not form a chloro-complex
j04-070-02|and therefore passes through in the feed solution and
j04-070-03|the first wash. The resin is used for a single
j04-070-04|separation and then thrown away. In the first stage
j04-070-05|of the analysis, only the fraction containing
j04-070-06|lead-210 is collected. The lead is precipitated as
j04-070-07|the chromate, washed, slurried onto an aluminium
j04-070-08|counting tray, dried under an infra-red lamp,
j04-070-09|weighed, and set aside for five days while the
j04-070-10|bismuth-210 grows in.
j04-076-00|At the end of five days, bismuth-210 will have
j04-076-01|reached one-half of its equilibrium value and
j04-076-02|can be counted through an aluminium absorber
j04-076-03|sufficiently thick to stop the beta particles
j04-076-04|from lead-210 and the alpha particles from
j04-076-05|polonium-210.
j04-080-00|During the first few hours the curve will be
j04-080-01|distorted if activity other than bismuth-
j04-080-02|210 is present. These bismuth nuclides may
j04-080-03|include: together with their lead parents.
j04-080-04|All but lead-212 will decay completely
j04-080-05|within six hours. The decay of lead-212
j04-080-06|will distort the observed activity for
j04-080-07|hour and a half days if it is
j04-080-08|present.
j04-094-00|If there is sufficient beta activity, the radioche-
j04-094-01|mical purity of the Bi-210 may be checked
j04-094-02|by observing the decay curve. The removal of lead
j04-094-03|chromate from the aluminium counting tray together
j04-094-04|with the bismuth-210 prior to the second ion
j04-094-05|exchange separation has been checked by
j04-094-06|counting the trays. Not more than 0.2 of the
j04-094-07|bismuth-210 remains on the tray after the
j04-094-08|acid wash.
j04-098-00|This loss is acceptably small for an analytical
j04-098-01|step when no correction for carrier
j04-098-02|recovery is possible. The completeness
j04-098-03|of the chemical exchange between the
j04-098-04|bismuth-210 and the added carrier was
j04-098-05|also tested. Two samples of precipitated
j04-098-06|lead chromate ( lead-210, bismuth-210)
j04-098-07|were counted and dissolved in nitric
j04-098-08|acid in silica basins. The contents
j04-098-09|were evaporated to dryness with
j04-098-10|bismuth carrier and then taken up in
j04-103-00|The bismuth was recovered from the eluate as the
j04-103-01|phosphate. Results did not differ from those obtained by the more
j04-103-02|convenient method of heating the dissolved chro-
j04-103-03|mates in 2 N hydrochloric acid for fifteen minutes. The more
j04-103-04|rigorous method of securing chemical exchange was unnecessary.
j04-103-05|Lead-210 when present in effluent is likely to be found
j04-103-06|only at very low concentrations.
j04-111-00|Table 1 shows the decontamination factors
j04-111-01|obtained experimentally for ten radionuclides,
j04-111-02|accompanied in two instances by radioactive dau-
j04-111-03|ghters. The decontamination factor falls below
j04-111-04|104 only for Ruthenium-106 and zirconium-95
j04-111-05|with their daughters in the first stage, i.e.
j04-111-06|the lead chromate source containing the bismuth-
j04-111-07|21 daughter. When the second stage ( the bismuth
j04-111-08|phosphate source) is completed, the decontami-
j04-111-09|nation factors are exceptionally high.
j04-115-00|A known quantity ( approx. 1 x 10-2 15mc) of
j04-115-01|lead-210 was added to 1-litre aliquots
j04-115-02|of different batches of typical low-activity
j04-115-03|effluent. The aliquots were allowed to
j04-115-04|stand for about seven days ( except
j04-115-05|where noted to the contrary) before lead
j04-115-06|carrier was added and the analytical
j04-115-07|procedure begun.
j06-000-00|All stages of Calanus, for example,
j06-000-01|seem to migrate on some occasions while
j06-000-02|any stage may not on others. Such data
j06-000-03|cannot yet be rationalized. Where
j06-000-04|information is less extensive, however, it is
j06-000-05|possible to find some regularity in the
j06-000-06|observations. Thus in Euphausia superba
j06-000-07|from the Antarctic, the metanauplii remain
j06-000-08|in deep water, the later larval stages
j06-000-09|migrate diurnally, and the adolescents
j06-000-10|stay permanently at the surface.
j06-005-00|The migrating stages all come from 100-250
j06-005-01|meters, and the time of their arrival at
j06-005-02|the surface is directly related to their
j06-005-03|swimming capacity: 3rd ( oldest)
j06-005-04|calyptopis from 1800-2200 hr; 2nd,
j06-005-05|from 2200-0200 hr; and 1st, from 0200-0600 hr.
j06-005-06|Similar ontogenetic differences are apparent
j06-005-07|in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain
j06-005-08|at the surface while the young migrate
j06-005-09|to and from a depth of 50 meters.
j06-008-00|Such permanent occurrence at the surface
j06-008-01|could of course be considered the extreme
j06-008-02|of a variable day depth. The effect of
j06-008-03|day depths upon the surfacing of various
j06-008-04|animals has been reviewed elsewhere. c.
j06-008-05|Anomalies. In spite of the variability
j06-008-06|of migrational behavior, some kinds
j06-008-07|of anomalies may be recognized.
j06-008-08|Vertical movement occurs in some forms
j06-008-09|apparently in the reverse manner to
j06-008-10|that commonly met.
j06-014-00|Such reversed migrations are known for
j06-014-01|Acartia clausi, A. longiremis, Nyctiphanes
j06-014-02|couchii, Evadne sp., Oithona nana, Daphnia
j06-014-03|lumholzi, Stages 4, 5, and adult of
j06-014-04|Calanus finmarchicus, Diaptomus banforanus,
j06-014-05|and Cyclops bicuspidatus. An echo-producing
j06-014-06|layer, which the authors think probably consists
j06-014-07|of euphausiids, has also been described
j06-014-08|as, in part, regularly moving in a reverse
j06-014-09|manner. Most of these records are well
j06-014-10|substantiated and involve whole populations
j06-014-11|rather than aberrant individuals.
j06-018-00|But normal movements have been
j06-018-01|reported also for the same species in
j06-018-02|the case of five of these examples
j06-018-03|and for other species in the same
j06-018-04|genera for the remaining Evadne,
j06-018-05|Daphnia, and Diaptomus. Many
j06-018-06|forms sometimes migrate and on other
j06-018-07|occasions do not, but a few
j06-018-08|appear to remain permanently at
j06-018-09|one level. Considering the widespread
j06-018-10|incidence of migration in the
j06-022-00|The most clearly substantiated case
j06-022-01|is that of the copepod Anomalocera
j06-022-02|patersoni, which remains permanently
j06-022-03|at the surface. Among other copepods
j06-022-04|Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus,
j06-022-05|Microcalanus pygmaeus, Oithona
j06-022-06|frigida, and Centropages typicus are
j06-022-07|reported as showing no migration.
j06-022-08|The predaceous cladoceran Bythotrephes
j06-022-09|longimanus also remains at one
j06-022-10|level, about 10 meters down.
j06-026-00|In view of its well-known normal
j06-026-01|migration, the occurrence of Calanus
j06-026-02|finmarchicus in the summer at
j06-026-03|the surface in bright sunlight
j06-026-04|may justly be considered anomalous.
j06-026-05|This phenomenon has nevertheless been
j06-026-06|recorded many times, and such
j06-026-07|surface Calanus may be present in
j06-026-08|enormous numbers, breaking the surface
j06-026-09|into small circular ripples like
j06-030-00|It seems likely that a continuous
j06-030-01|interchange was taking place between
j06-030-02|the population at the surface and
j06-030-03|that in deeper water. A second
j06-030-04|group whose normal vertical
j06-030-05|migration is sufficiently well
j06-030-06|known to make daytime
j06-030-07|occurrence at the surface
j06-030-08|rank as anomalous is the
j06-030-09|Euphausiacea. There are numerous
j06-030-10|records of euphausiids swimming
j06-034-00|2. Mechanisms. The majority of
j06-034-01|vertical migrations undoubtedly
j06-034-02|result from active swimming
j06-034-03|although passive movement through
j06-034-04|the water has been suggested on
j06-034-05|various grounds. For example,
j06-034-06|transport in vertical currents
j06-034-07|resulting from temperature diff-
j06-034-08|erences has been proposed; diff-
j06-034-09|erences in water viscosity after
j06-034-10|temperature changes have also been
j06-051-00|Downward movement may in some forms
j06-051-01|start as a passive sinking, especially
j06-051-02|when it occurs before dawn; but this
j06-051-03|must almost certainly be replaced
j06-051-04|by the headfirst downward swimming
j06-051-05|observed in the field. 3. Initiating,
j06-051-06|controlling, and orienting factors. The
j06-051-07|primary dependence of diurnal
j06-051-08|migrations upon changes in light intensity
j06-051-09|is beyond doubt. Yet in spite
j06-051-10|of a great amount of work,
j06-056-00|Loeb first suggested the importance
j06-056-01|of light as the governing factor
j06-056-02|but combined its influence with that
j06-056-03|of gravity. Later authors, in particular
j06-056-04|Rose, have proposed that light
j06-056-05|alone can provide an adequate
j06-056-06|mechanism if the animals have,
j06-056-07|and select by exploration, a
j06-056-08|zone of optimum light intensity.
j06-056-09|This view has been enlarged
j06-056-10|with a suggestion that both
j07-000-00|This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be
j07-000-01|obtained with tubular constructions. The growth of the
j07-000-02|aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need
j07-000-03|for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930's,
j07-000-04|the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction
j07-000-05|became established for aero-engine radiators, using
j07-000-06|dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages
j07-000-07|were separated by flat plates.
j07-005-00|The air passages were packed with corrugated
j07-005-01|foil bonded to the primary plates to
j07-005-02|provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer.
j07-005-03|The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil,
j07-005-04|chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand
j07-005-05|the coolant pressure loadings. The introduction of the aluminium alloy
j07-005-06|dip-brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up
j07-005-07|for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial
j07-005-08|weight reductions as compared with copper construction.
j07-009-00|This development coincided with the introduction of
j07-009-01|pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air
j07-009-02|cabin coolers. Although in this case the heat transfer
j07-009-03|coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger
j07-009-04|were of comparable magnitude, the use of
j07-009-05|secondary surface was still attractive, since the
j07-009-06|greater part of the surface area could be made up
j07-009-07|of fins only 0.006 in. ( 0.15 mm.) thick.
j07-012-00|Furthermore, developments in the detail form of
j07-012-01|the fins made possible a reduction in the total
j07-012-02|surface area required as compared with the use of
j07-012-03|smooth continuous passages for the same thermal
j07-012-04|duty and pressure losses. The properties of
j07-012-05|compact form, low weight, and design flexibility
j07-012-06|thus developed found ready application on a
j07-012-07|much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage
j07-012-08|scale air separation plants.
j07-015-00|The basic method of construction is both simple and
j07-015-01|extremely flexible. Figure 3 illustrates the
j07-015-02|arrangement of a single passage. This can be
j07-015-03|extended in length and width up to the limit of
j07-015-04|manufacturing equipment available. The corrugation
j07-015-05|is machine-formed, thus ensuring a high standard
j07-015-06|of uniformity in height and fin pitch.
k01-051-00|Though that was not quite the phrase, for even
k01-051-01|if he could succeed Sir Charles he would, as
k01-051-02|an executive, be eternally differentiated from
k01-051-03|the Governors. Fairbanks managed the Governors
k01-051-04|beautifully, he knew more than they, he was
k01-051-05|cleverer than most, discreetly used their Christian
k01-051-06|names - but remained their servant. They had
k01-051-07|no office hours, however elastic; their lives were
k01-051-08|spent in committee making decisions for others
k01-051-09|to execute on the basis of data laboriously
k02-018-00|The gin pahits, and now the beer with the
k02-018-01|curry, had their desired effect on us;
k02-018-02|or rather, on Nigel and myself. Lee, I
k02-018-03|noticed, had asked for Coca-Cola. This
k02-018-04|rather surprised me from a young man
k02-018-05|who was otherwise so sophisticated. He
k02-018-06|was not, however, ostentatious about
k02-018-07|the matter.
k02-023-00|If anything, he had merely become a little more reserved, and
k02-023-01|much more polite. I thought to myself: ' A few years in the
k02-023-02|East, my boy, and you 'll drink - I 've seen your kind be-
k02-023-03|fore! ' After the curry, I wanted only to go upstairs to
k02-023-04|bed. I had long since become accustomed, and now addicted,
k02-023-05|to an after-curry nap.
k02-023-06|Verena Holenstein
k02-029-00|Lee, however, showed not the slightest sign of fatigue. ' I
k02-029-01|wonder if you 'd mind if I took a bit of a look round, '
k02-029-02|he asked Nigel. ' I don't sleep in the afternoons. ' Nigel,
k02-029-03|I must say, was very good about it. I knew how much
k02-029-04|he probably wanted to sleep himself. But, almost
k02-029-05|gallantly, he said:
k02-036-00|' Not at all. I 'll show you. ' ' Oh no, '
k02-036-01|young Lee protested, considerate as always.
k02-036-02|' That 's not necessary if you want to rest, sir.
k02-036-03|I 'm sure I won't do any harm. ' Nigel
k02-036-04|laughed. I had not known he was so
k02-036-05|good-natured. But then, I suppose I had
k02-036-06|never given him similar cause to display
k02-036-07|such amiability.
k02-053-00|I slept soundly, and much later than I should. It
k02-053-01|was already after six when I awoke, and the sun
k02-053-02|was nearly setting beyond the west window.
k02-053-03|Downstairs I could hear the murmur of voices,
k02-053-04|and knew they were back. I wondered, as I
k02-053-05|wrapped a 6sarong around my waist, if
k02-053-06|Nigel at all resented being deprived of his
k02-053-07|afternoon sleep.
k02-062-00|And I said to myself: Oh, God, doesn't the
k02-062-01|boy ever relax! He turned his gaze away
k02-062-02|from me almost instantly, but it had
k02-062-03|been enough to make me conscious of the
k02-062-04|nakedness of the upper half of my body, even
k02-062-05|of the matted grey hairs on my chest. He
k02-062-06|probably thought my appearance quite a breach
k02-062-07|of the social graces; but, naturally, he said
k02-062-08|not so much as a word about it.
k02-067-00|' We 've just had tea, ' Nigel said. ' Would you like
k02-067-01|the cookie to make you a fresh lot? ' ' I 'd rather
k02-067-02|have whisky, ' I told him. ' Thought as much.
k02-067-03|Sun 's nearly below the yard-arm, anyway.
k02-067-04|Wouldn't mind a stengah myself. How about
k02-067-05|you, Harry? ' So they had managed to come
k02-067-06|to the stage of using each other's Christian
k02-067-07|names, I noted.
k02-076-00|Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as
k02-076-01|reserved as I thought. ' Thanks,
k02-076-02|Nigel, ' he said. ' Just Coca-Cola.
k02-076-03|Although I 'd like to have
k02-076-04|whatever you have. I want to
k02-076-05|get to know the kind of life
k02-076-06|people lead in the East, you know. '
k02-076-07|At this, I felt a return of the
k02-076-08|irritation I felt with him
k02-076-09|at times.
k02-093-00|Knowing Nigel, I would have been surprised if he
k02-093-01|had not made his usual ' arrangements '. A bachelor
k02-093-02|himself, he knew well how to entertain his bachelor
k02-093-03|friends. He caught my look and pursed his lips in
k02-093-04|a quick little grimace of acknowledgement; then raised
k02-093-05|an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's direction.
k02-097-00|I shrugged a shoulder. Lee would have
k02-097-01|to decide about that for himself, I
k02-097-02|thought, and noticed that although he
k02-097-03|was looking at the other girl, he did
k02-097-04|so quite dispassionately, almost as though
k02-097-05|he was merely interested in the unfamiliar
k02-097-06|clothes she was wearing. And I thought
k02-097-07|to myself: He may be still too much of
k02-097-08|a ' new chum ' to see ' the beauty of
k02-097-09|the East '.
k02-102-00|There was still an ease in our conversation, but its
k02-102-01|scope was restricted. I felt that I could hardly make the
k02-102-02|usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses
k02-102-03|as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him, much as I
k02-102-04|wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment.
k02-102-05|And I suppose he felt the same. We had only a few drinks,
k02-102-06|then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
k02-102-07|dinner.
k02-112-00|He had one of the better Kashmir carpets on
k02-112-01|the floor. His pictures and curtains, indeed I
k02-112-02|suppose the entire furnishings, had been se-
k02-112-03|lected personally. The house was, as he
k02-112-04|occasionally proclaimed, his home - and he had
k02-112-05|made it as such. I doubt if he will ever
k02-112-06|leave Malaya, even when he retires.
k02-117-00|The country, and his mistresses, have come
k02-117-01|to mean too much to him. And, indirectly,
k02-117-02|this impression I had of him was one of several
k02-117-03|reasons why I had decided I should leave
k02-117-04|it - before, for me too, it would be too late.
k02-117-05|I used the excuse of our early start in the
k02-117-06|morning to retire as soon as it seemed
k02-117-07|prudent to do so, after the coffee and brandy,
k02-117-08|already anticipating the familiar pleasures
k02-117-09|awaiting me.
k03-117-00|After lunch two of the Prime Minister's
k03-117-01|grandchildren who had sat, rather intimidated
k03-117-02|by Ormston and staring at the Grinling
k03-117-03|Gibbons carving around the fireplace, rose
k03-117-04|gratefully from the table, leaving the two
k03-117-05|men together. A nurse came in, and asked
k03-117-06|the Prime Minister if he wanted to be
k03-117-07|helped out on to the lawn, but he waved
k03-117-08|her away impatiently.
k03-138-00|I don't mean just our direct military costs. I 'm
k03-138-01|thinking of the African Boycott which is already working up.
k03-138-02|I 'm afraid, Prime Minister, you 're not going to like the
k03-138-03|trading position when you see it. ' ' I never do, ' the
k03-138-04|Prime Minister commented wearily. The Chancellor
k03-138-05|was repeating an argument which he had already
k03-138-06|developed for an hour before lunch.
k03-144-00|' It comes at a bad time, ' said
k03-144-01|Ormston. ' A singularly bad time. The
k03-144-02|Party 's very restless, you know. ' ' It
k03-144-03|is a sign of life - very encouraging! '
k03-144-04|' The younger men - ' ' Which ones? '
k03-144-05|' The younger ones like Gore, Vaughan,
k03-144-06|Hadley, Prebble, Lambert-Price - the
k03-144-07|New Africa lot - ' ' Do they confide
k03-144-08|in you? Have you spoken to them? '
k03-152-00|' Only at yesterday's meeting - they 're very restless, Prime
k03-152-01|Minister. They feel that it 's very old-fashioned - shooting
k03-152-02|down mobs of natives. They 're very much afraid that
k03-152-03|if the Opposition get a Commission of Enquiry some
k03-152-04|rather dismal stuff is going to come out. '
k03-152-05|' Young back-benchers are always restive when they 're
k03-152-06|bored, ' said the Prime Minister, and for the first
k03-152-07|time since his grandchildren left the table, he smiled.
k03-157-00|' Why don't you give them something to play with? '
k03-157-01|' They 've found their own toy, ' said Ormston,
k03-157-02|' and this is it. They want to abstain next week. '
k03-157-03|The Prime Minister continued in his flippant
k03-157-04|tone, ' Tell the Chief to give them a
k03-157-05|talking-to. ' The Chancellor closed his eyes,
k03-157-06|and then said,
k03-164-00|' I think it 's gone beyond that, Prime Minister.
k03-164-01|They feel pretty strongly about Africa. They are greatly
k03-164-02|disturbed by the new and rather ugly image of
k03-164-03|the Party which our African policy is creating.
k03-164-04|On the whole, the country is still in favour
k03-164-05|of moderation and common sense. Melville has
k03-164-06|in a curious way made us look old-fashioned
k03-164-07|- extravagant - nineteenth centuryish -
k03-164-08|almost cranky. '
k03-180-00|The Prime Minister looked puzzled, and said, ' Julia Drayford? How
k03-180-01|does she come into it? I can't follow these complexities - ' ' It isn't
k03-180-02|quite that. The whole business blew up from Melville's disgraceful
k03-180-03|indiscretion to Julia Drayford in Mrs. M'landa's presence.
k03-180-04|I don't know the exact chain of gossip or who told who
k03-180-05|what.
k04-000-00|As he turned aside his head, since he could not
k04-000-01|bear to look at her beautiful, pleading face, he was
k04-000-02|suddenly attacked by suspicion. ' You wish to marry
k04-000-03|someone else! ' he cried in a voice roughened by
k04-000-04|jealousy. She sighed deeply, and looked away. ' Do you?
k04-000-05|Do you? ' he repeated, fiercely.
k04-005-00|' If, ' she said gently, giving him a look that set his pulses throbbing,
k04-005-01|' if I wished to marry some young gallant, do you think I would
k04-005-02|ask your help? You would be the last man I would ask. ' Before
k04-005-03|he could collect his wits to reply to this, there was a bustle
k04-005-04|and confusion at the end of the room. Prince Doria had
k04-005-05|wearied of his toy and was packing it away in its painted
k04-005-06|coffer.
k04-010-00|The party was now preparing to see
k04-010-01|the tapestries, and in the general
k04-010-02|movement, Vittoria was separated from
k04-010-03|Orsini. Although neither of them
k04-010-04|wished to follow the sightseers, there seemed
k04-010-05|no alternative. As she was about to mount
k04-010-06|a wide and shallow flight of marble
k04-010-07|stairs, she became aware of someone
k04-010-08|watching her intently, and turning
k04-010-09|in that direction, she saw Olimpia,
k04-010-10|standing beside her admirer, Orlando Cavalcanti.
k04-014-00|The young man was bending over her with the
k04-014-01|assiduity of a lover, but the girl appeared to be more
k04-014-02|interested in her cousin's wife, whom she was regarding
k04-014-03|through half-closed eyes. This was a slight shock to
k04-014-04|Vittoria, who had forgotten the existence of the girl,
k04-014-05|and, up to this moment had been unaware of the
k04-014-06|young man's presence at the palazzo.
k04-028-00|I like to think it may have fallen from the dark
k04-028-01|hair of the Empress Messalina, as she crouched
k04-028-02|in terror in the gardens of Lucullus, awaiting the
k04-028-03|sword of the executioner. ' ' Ah! ' exclaimed
k04-028-04|Farnese, with a snigger. ' The old cuckold
k04-028-05|Claudius had the last word, after all. He
k04-028-06|knew how to deal with an adulterous wife,
k04-028-07|eh, Orsini? '
k04-033-00|If the duke made any reply to this, Vittoria did
k04-033-01|not hear it. Now they entered the long gallery
k04-033-02|where they dispersed and wandered around, admiring
k04-033-03|and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric
k04-033-04|splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought
k04-033-05|back from Lepanto. After a short interval, Orsini
k04-033-06|found an opportunity to rejoin Vittoria.
k04-033-07|' We must talk further, ' he said in a low
k04-033-08|urgent voice. ' Where? '
k04-039-00|' Be careful, ' she whispered from behind her fan.
k04-039-01|' Olimpia is watching us. The young man with her is
k04-039-02|Orlando Cavalcanti, Francesco's friend. ' Orsini
k04-039-03|shot an impatient glance at the couple. ' The young man
k04-039-04|with the mole? ' ' Yes, indeed. ' ' No matter. They are not
k04-039-05|looking at us. Now I must know, ' he whispered, ' what
k04-039-06|you meant, cara mia. Do you want your freedom in order
k04-039-07|to marry? '
k04-050-00|Before replying to this, she glanced
k04-050-01|hastily around, then spoke in tones so low that he
k04-050-02|had to bend his head to hear: ' I will never be
k04-050-03|any man's mistress. As to marrying again...
k04-050-04|if I were free... there is only one man I would
k04-050-05|wish to marry... but... he, like myself, is now
k04-050-06|bound. '
k04-054-00|With a swift gesture she closed her fan
k04-054-01|and moved away from him towards the group
k04-054-02|in the centre of the gallery, leaving him standing
k04-054-03|alone, against that glowing, barbaric background,
k04-054-04|with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face.
k04-054-05|On a bright unclouded morning a few days after
k04-054-06|the visit to the Doria Palace, the cardinal's
k04-054-07|coach left the villa, lurched over the unpaved
k04-054-08|track and turned towards the ruined Baths
k04-054-09|of Diocletian.
k04-057-00|Vittoria, accompanied by her maid, Lucia, was on her
k04-057-01|way to the Accoramboni villa, ostensibly to pay
k04-057-02|a daughterly call on her father, actually to coax
k04-057-03|money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting
k04-057-04|debts. Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress
k04-057-05|looked, and how cunningly the olive-green dress
k04-057-06|with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her
k04-057-07|perfect figure. Vittoria's thoughts were more complex.
k04-061-00|The sparkling society of the Doria Palace, the flattery
k04-061-01|of Orsini's obsession, the thwarted ambitions of her
k04-061-02|restless spirit, all threw into sharp relief the contrast
k04-061-03|of her grey life with the splendid one that filled
k04-061-04|her dreams. At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien,
k04-061-05|and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco
k04-061-06|to give her a separate establishment, he invariably
k04-061-07|pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle, who
k04-061-08|had built the villa for his family.
k04-064-00|He reminded her that they must abide by Roman
k04-064-01|custom, and dwell there with their relations. Her
k04-064-02|values were those of the materialist who assesses
k04-064-03|every human being in terms of fame, power and
k04-064-04|wealth. Francesco she despised for his dullness, his
k04-064-05|lack of initiative, his subservience to his uncle.
k04-068-00|Her husband's gentleness and amiability, his unselfish
k04-068-01|love for her, she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a
k04-068-02|futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
k04-068-03|her a child. Whatever passion she had experienced in the
k04-068-04|first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt.
k04-068-05|She had never loved him. Her thoughts rushed to Orsini.
k04-068-06|Since the meeting in the Doria Palace, no word had
k04-068-07|come from him, and this silence oppressed her spirits
k04-068-08|with a weight of misgiving.
k04-075-00|She had, perhaps, demanded too much. The
k04-075-01|kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus-
k04-075-02|pected depths in her, and she knew that
k04-075-03|if she yielded to him, her passion could,
k04-075-04|indeed, match his. Every instinct urged her to
k04-075-05|surrender, for there was that in his nature
k04-075-06|to which her own had responded as it
k04-075-07|had responded to no other human being.
k04-079-00|Prudence, ambition and reason had
k04-079-01|held instinct in check, and they must
k04-079-02|dictate her course. There could be no
k04-079-03|compromise. For a brief interval
k04-079-04|she allowed herself the luxury of
k04-079-05|dreams. She began to imagine life at
k04-079-06|Bracciano, the balls and fe*?5tes, the
k04-079-07|conversation of poets and dilettanti. She
k04-079-08|visualized the pageantry of the tourna-
k04-079-09|ment, and herself on the ducal dais beside
k04-079-10|Orsini, placing a chaplet of roses on the brows
k04-085-00|This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a
k04-085-01|sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop, nearly throwing
k04-085-02|the two girls from their seats. Lucia uttered a cry of
k04-085-03|alarm. ' Look, madonna, we are surrounded! ' It was true.
k04-085-04|Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about
k04-085-05|them and a lean, swarthy fellow was peering through
k04-085-06|the window, grinning impudently. ' Santa Maria! '
k04-085-07|shrieked Lucia. ' Banditti! '
k04-093-00|Vittoria now realized that they were outside
k04-093-01|Santa Maria degli Angeli, and that except for a few beggars
k04-093-02|crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting
k04-093-03|loathsome sores, the area was deserted. ' They are not banditti,
k04-093-04|Lucia, ' said Vittoria, pointing to the badge on the man's
k04-093-05|shoulder. The words were clear. ' Beware my hug! ' Lucia
k04-093-06|stared speechlessly at the golden bear; Vittoria swiftly
k04-093-07|averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance
k04-093-08|of the retainer.
k04-099-00|Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic. The
k04-099-01|coach now turned in another direction, towards
k04-099-02|the wild and desolate region behind the baths.
k04-099-03|It was sparsely inhabited, dotted with fallow fields
k04-099-04|and terraced vineyards, and here and there jutted
k04-099-05|a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins, a pathetic
k04-099-06|reminder of Rome's former greatness.
k04-103-00|In this region of Monti most of the public baths
k04-103-01|had been built in the time of the Caesars, but with the
k04-103-02|breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
k04-103-03|the baths had lost their purpose; they had become
k04-103-04|stone quarries and their precious marble had been
k04-103-05|burnt for lime. Now escaped criminals and bandits
k04-103-06|used these quarries as hiding places, to the danger
k04-103-07|of travellers in the district.
k04-106-00|As they lumbered past at a rattling pace, Vittoria
k04-106-01|could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a
k04-106-02|gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures
k04-106-03|gathered about it, cooking their frugal meal. These
k04-106-04|were left far behind. An old man belabouring an
k04-106-05|overladen donkey, and a withered crone appeared
k04-106-06|on the horizon, were overtaken and forgotten.
k04-110-00|Except for their escort, Vittoria and
k04-110-01|Lucia might have been the only living
k04-110-02|creatures on an empty planet. After the
k04-110-03|initial shock, Vittoria felt calm. She
k04-110-04|knew exactly what she wanted, and
k04-110-05|was prepared to take it without scruple,
k04-110-06|if she could. What she had forgotten
k04-110-07|in her self-absorption in her own schemes
k04-110-08|was that other people were equally absorbed
k04-110-09|in their schemes, which were likely to
k04-110-10|run counter to her own.
k04-115-00|This move today was a reminder of that fact.
k04-115-01|Whilst she automatically patted the hand of
k04-115-02|the agitated Lucia, her brain was working
k04-115-03|rapidly, and she decided that she must be
k04-115-04|prepared to counter Orsini's demands,
k04-115-05|difficult though that would be. She became
k04-115-06|aware that the pace was slackening;
k04-115-07|now the coach stopped.
k04-119-00|The moment had come. Upon the ensuing interview
k04-119-01|the future would depend. Outwardly she was calm, but
k04-119-02|her heart was beating fast, and the palms of her
k04-119-03|hands were damp. Orsini's high-crowned hat with
k04-119-04|its jaunty plume blotted out the light; his hand
k04-119-05|was on the door. Glancing at Lucia he said in
k04-119-06|French to Vittoria: ' Your maid... is she reliable? '
k04-126-00|She shrugged her shoulders, and replied in the same
k04-126-01|language: ' Yes. But make it worth her while. '
k04-126-02|' I see. I know how to deal with people like that, '
k04-126-03|and turning to the cowering Lucia, he spoke in her
k04-126-04|own language. ' Do you know who I am? ' ' No,
k04-126-05|signor, ' she whispered. ' I am the Orsini. My word is
k04-126-06|law in Rome. '
k04-136-00|Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat.
k04-136-01|Thrusting his head farther into the coach, he said
k04-136-02|sombrely: ' Have you ever heard of a punishment called
k04-136-03|the cord? ' She blanched and shrank away. Was there not
k04-136-04|a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda
k04-136-05|where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty, fifty,
k04-136-06|sixty feet into the air, and dropped again and again, until
k04-136-07|their arms were wrenched from their sockets. ' You have
k04-136-08|heard of it?
k04-142-00|The Orsini give that to traitors. There is
k04-142-01|no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini. We hunt
k04-142-02|a traitor down to the ends of the earth, and no
k04-142-03|power can save him... or her. Do you understand? '
k04-142-04|' Yes, signor, ' she faltered. ' On the other hand, ' he
k04-142-05|continued, giving her a keen look, ' the Orsini are
k04-142-06|generous to those who serve them faithfully.
k04-149-00|Remember that, my girl. ' Lucia was beyond
k04-149-01|speech. He turned to Vittoria, sitting erect,
k04-149-02|with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with
k04-149-03|anger. ' And now, madonna, ' he said smoothly, ' we will
k04-149-04|continue the conversation started at the Doria
k04-149-05|Palace. Be pleased to alight. ' ' I think, ' she replied
k04-149-06|coolly, ' I prefer to stay where I am. '
k04-156-00|' In that case, ' he reverted to French, ' I shall be obliged
k04-156-01|to lift you from the coach. ' Without answering him, she
k04-156-02|rose, and bending over the agitated girl, said softly:
k04-156-03|' No one will harm you, Lucia. Remain here. ' Ignoring his
k04-156-04|proffered hand, she stepped from the vehicle. ' Will you
k04-156-05|be so good as to order your men not to molest my
k04-156-06|maid, ' she said coldly to Orsini.
k04-163-00|' She is absolutely safe, ' he replied; but he turned,
k04-163-01|nevertheless, to the man who had peered into the
k04-163-02|coach, whom he had addressed as Luigi, and gave him sharp
k04-163-03|instructions on the matter. Vittoria stood looking about her,
k04-163-04|breathing the scent of thyme. The land at her feet sloped
k04-163-05|away into a tiny valley beyond which, on the crest
k04-163-06|of a wooded hill-side, the ruins of a small temple
k04-163-07|were etched against the clear blue of the sky.
k07-059a-00|He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently
k07-059a-01|led along erotic paths which he knew existed, but
k07-059a-02|had never trodden. He learned how to use his
k07-059a-03|hands, how to adore that body without haste, how
k07-059a-04|to caress every inch with his mouth as well, to
k07-059a-05|creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
k07-059a-06|himself in a rapture of kisses in places he 'd
k07-059a-07|dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened
k07-059a-08|his heart beat to a thunder.
k07-063a-00|He looked at her. Head thrown back in a pool of hair,
k07-063a-01|her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her
k07-063a-02|heart in the full throat. Her mouth did things he
k07-063a-03|thought no human being could stand without
k07-063a-04|dying, but he went on living in an ocean of
k07-063a-05|voluptuousness, that swelled and ebbed over him,
k07-063a-06|under him, in him and through him...
k07-067a-00|He was having a ball! He twiddled the TV set with
k07-067a-01|shaking hands. She sat calmly on the bed smoking
k07-067a-02|a cigarette. His face was white with two red
k07-067a-03|blotches. Hers was flushed and lovely. O.K. teacher!
k07-067a-04|Was that any better? You know it was! You don't
k07-067a-05|need teaching, only a little coaxing.
k07-077-00|He sat down and ran his finger down along her
k07-077-01|spine. Do you love me now? Like yesterday! I 'm
k07-077-02|extremely fond of you. The fact that you 're beginning
k07-077-03|to satisfy my physical wants does not change that.
k07-077-04|Before long you 'll give me the satisfaction that 'll set
k07-077-05|me rocking on my feet, but I 'll still be only fond of
k07-077-06|you. But you wouldn't marry me?
k07-085-00|No. I 'm not your type. I 'd make you miserable. I
k07-085-01|mean that. I 'd very probably be unfaithful and
k07-085-02|that 'd kill you. Then I 'd be unfaithful too, to teach
k07-085-03|you a lesson. It wouldn't work. You 'd do it to
k07-085-04|spite me. I would never do it for that reason.
k07-085-05|To me it 'd be immaterial whether you 'd retaliate
k07-085-06|or not. You 'd go crazy if that situation arose.
k07-122-00|To observe the colour rise in her cheek
k07-122-01|and hear her breath come faster, to see
k07-122-02|the slight beads of sweat come out on
k07-122-03|her glistening skin and see her move
k07-122-04|with uncontrolled rhythm. To have her twist
k07-122-05|in an attempt to receive a caress he was
k07-122-06|purposely withholding, to hear her deep-throated
k07-122-07|moan of full satisfaction and feel her
k07-122-08|shivering, clawing surrender.
k07-125-00|Not so dusty, she might say afterwards, drawing at
k07-125-01|a cigarette. It 's a wow! he said. She kissed
k07-125-02|him motherly: You just wait till you teach the
k07-125-03|girl you really love. He didn't protest any more
k07-125-04|to say he loved her because he knew it to
k07-125-05|be untrue. Instead he said: Will that be
k07-125-06|better? She nodded:
k07-134-00|It 's man's nature to teach and to teach those
k07-134-01|we love is double pleasure. And she
k07-134-02|might add: And don't forget to leave the
k07-134-03|lights on. You lose half the fun when you
k07-134-04|fumble in the dark. She had many direct
k07-134-05|comments like that. Once she quietly
k07-134-06|pushed him back when he kissed her too
k07-134-07|fully and too soon:
k07-141-00|Oi, not yet, you oaf. What do you think my
k07-141-01|mouth is? A billposter's bucket to be
k07-141-02|plunged in at random? He 'd learned to
k07-141-03|laugh when something went wrong or the
k07-141-04|situation became ludicrous, as when they
k07-141-05|were both caught in the raw when he 'd
k07-141-06|forgotten to lock his door and Derek
k07-141-07|had walked in unexpectedly.
k07-146-00|They 'd just had time to nip into the
k07-146-01|bathroom and stood there shivering for
k07-146-02|fifteen minutes while their guest was
k07-146-03|smoking a cigarette waiting for him.
k07-146-04|At last Derek got tired and left.
k07-146-05|Just in time, erupted Charlie. If he 'd
k07-146-06|stayed any longer I 'd jolly well
k07-146-07|have asked him to join us. I 'm so
k07-146-08|darned cold I could do with two men.
k07-152-00|You perverted sex-maniac, you wouldn't
k07-152-01|dare. Show me what you can do and
k07-152-02|I 'll tell you if you need help.
k07-152-03|Once he came back to the subject
k07-152-04|of her marriage and asked her why
k07-152-05|she was going to marry her sculptor.
k07-152-06|Because I love him, of course.
k07-152-07|What do you think?
k07-158-00|But he 's a lot older, isn't he?
k07-158-01|I suppose so. What attracts you?
k07-158-02|It can't be physical? Of course
k07-158-03|not! I love him for what he is
k07-158-04|- he 's so great I 'm a bit scared
k07-158-05|of him - a woman must be a bit
k07-158-06|scared to be really in love.
k07-158-07|That 's why you could never
k07-158-08|love me?
k07-166-00|Correct, ducky! You just wait till
k07-166-01|you meet the girl who thinks you 're a
k07-166-02|god. It 'll make you feel like one!
k07-166-03|You think that sculptor 's a god?
k07-166-04|Perhaps, in a way. All I know is
k07-166-05|that I need him. He kissed the
k07-166-06|heart beat in her throat. But how
k07-166-07|about the physical side? You 're
k07-166-08|quite an erotic little beast; can
k07-166-09|he satisfy that?
k07-176-00|You youngsters always overestimate
k07-176-01|yourselves. You can take it from
k07-176-02|me that he can and does. But
k07-176-03|even if he were impotent I 'd still
k07-176-04|love and want him. There are
k07-176-05|sides to me you 'll never know.
k07-176-06|Don't you feel guilty living with
k07-176-07|me? Often! Don't you? Mary had
k07-176-08|married her bill broker some time
k07-176-09|ago and he now shuddered when he
k07-176-10|remembered the clinical weekends
k07-176-11|he used to spend with her.
k07-185-00|He often used to try to imagine
k07-185-01|her reactions if he had once treated
k07-185-02|her as he did Charlie, but his
k07-185-03|imagination failed. The efficient
k07-185-04|little Mary would probably have
k07-185-05|called it a shocking waste of time
k07-185-06|and told him to get down to
k07-185-07|business! Charlie, who was perfectly
k07-185-08|at home at all sorts of artistic
k07-185-09|circles, had amongst others wangled
k07-185-10|him a membership ticket for a
k07-185-11|small club for artists only.
l01-000-00|He did well. He got in touch with
l01-000-01|the woman Pete was passing off as his
l01-000-02|mother. Starmouth managed to
l01-000-03|win her confidence. It seems that
l01-000-04|she was an honest enough woman,
l01-000-05|only her mind wasn't as clear as
l01-000-06|it could have been. She showed
l01-000-07|him photographs. He found out
l01-000-08|that the name of her house - Grand
l01-000-09|Greve - was taken from a bay
l01-000-10|in one of the Channel Islands.
l01-007-00|One of the small ones. Sark, that 's it. The Caxtons
l01-007-01|used to have their holidays there. Starmouth went
l01-007-02|there. He dug out some people who remembered
l01-007-03|the family. In the end he pieced it all together.
l01-007-04|The Caxtons had two boys - Michael and Derek.
l01-007-05|Pete first met them at school.
l01-016-00|It was a good school I sent him to, one of the best.
l01-016-01|He was a boarder. He could always turn on the
l01-016-02|charm when it suited him. The whole family
l01-016-03|came to like him. The real Michael - he was the
l01-016-04|same age as my son - died of pleurisy when he
l01-016-05|was eighteen. Soon after that Pete staged his
l01-016-06|drowning.
l01-023-00|He was always a smooth liar. He invented some
l01-023-01|plausible story or other and threw himself on
l01-023-02|the Caxtons' generosity. They accepted him as a
l01-023-03|kind of substitute for the boy they had lost.
l01-023-04|Outside the family he began to pass himself
l01-023-05|off as Michael Caxton. The father was well-off
l01-023-06|and easy-going. He was easy meat for Pete.
l01-030-00|He sponged off him until he died
l01-030-01|just after the war. Then Pete had to
l01-030-02|look around for some other
l01-030-03|security. He found it - Dackson's Wharf,
l01-030-04|and Dackson's daughter. Mrs. Caxton's
l01-030-05|other boy, Derek, had been killed in the war.
l01-030-06|After her husband died her brain began
l01-030-07|to fade. At times she thought Pete was
l01-030-08|really her own son.
l01-050-00|My chance had come at last. I had to
l01-050-01|take it. I was going to smash him as
l01-050-02|he had twice tried to smash me. ( His
l01-050-03|eyes, wild and frightened, were fixed on
l01-050-04|Tong. Tong guessed that they did not
l01-050-05|see him.) I told Starmouth to go at
l01-050-06|once and report exactly what he had
l01-050-07|seen to Dackson and his daughter.
l01-050-08|He did as he was told.
l01-065-00|Carol Carstairs, interviewed by
l01-065-01|Passon and Tong for the second time,
l01-065-02|began by agreeing that she could
l01-065-03|have been mistaken about the
l01-065-04|precise minute of Dackson's visit
l01-065-05|the previous Wednesday, and ended
l01-065-06|by admitting that he was in fact
l01-065-07|at least half an hour late for
l01-065-08|his appointment with her." There
l01-065-09|it is," Passon commented
l01-065-10|afterwards." She is a business
l01-065-11|woman.
l01-082-00|" Another was the body fetching up on the mooring-hook - practically where
l01-082-01|it started from."" And you finding out about the spy at the Marshams',
l01-082-02|" Passon said." Just a stroke of luck, sir," Tong said." Luck or not,
l01-082-03|Harry, it was the real turning-point for us. Must be true what they
l01-082-04|say. ' Tong can't go wrong! '"
l01-095-00|When Nick returned home he found that his
l01-095-01|mother was seriously ill. She had pneumonia. The
l01-095-02|sight of her youngest son, the doctor said, was the
l01-095-03|only thing that saved her; it gave her the strength
l01-095-04|she needed to fight for life. Soon she was out of
l01-095-05|danger, but the doctor told Dan that she would
l01-095-06|have to remain in bed for some time and
l01-095-07|that thereafter it was essential that she should
l01-095-08|not have to exert herself.
l01-105-00|With Grace helpless Rose set up her
l01-105-01|own autocracy. Her squeaking, querulous
l01-105-02|accents were heard without inter-
l01-105-03|mission. They rose over the baby's inter-
l01-105-04|minable howling and were directed at
l01-105-05|everyone in equal measure. She was
l01-105-06|a poor and unpunctual cook. Normally
l01-105-07|indolent, she was now and again seized
l01-105-08|with unpredictable bouts of energy in
l01-105-09|the grip of which she swept through
l01-105-10|the house with a fury that disarranged
l01-111-00|Only the old man's room was too much for
l01-111-01|her. Once she put her head round the door,
l01-111-02|and Sam shouted:" You get right out of
l01-111-03|this, Rose. You leave me in peace."
l01-111-04|Rose took one breath of the stagnant air.
l01-111-05|" You - you polecat!" she screeched, and
l01-111-06|retreated without argument. Her re*?
l01-111-07|2gime, hated alike by all the men,
l01-111-08|produced one extraordinary result.
l01-119-00|One day Fred met Nick at the front door as they were both
l01-119-01|about to enter the house. Fred grasped his brother's elbow.
l01-119-02|" Nick, I can't stomach this much longer."" Nor me. What 's the
l01-119-03|answer? Mum 's picking up, but she 'll never be her old self
l01-119-04|again."
l01-119-05|" That First Flower 's driving me nuts," Fred said." I 'm going to put
l01-119-06|a stop to it."
l01-119-07|" What with - arsenic?"
l01-129-00|Fred fixed his small eyes on his brother, beckoned
l01-129-01|him to stand closer, and whispered into his
l01-129-02|ear the most unexpected words Nick had
l01-129-03|ever heard." I 'm going to get myself
l01-129-04|married," Fred said. The next day he
l01-129-05|brought home a woman in her middle
l01-129-06|thirties and took her straight to his
l01-129-07|mother's bedside.
l01-133-00|" Mum, this is Maggie. I 'm going to marry her,
l01-133-01|and I 'd like her to come and live with us."
l01-133-02|Maggie was plump and plain with a pleasing
l01-133-03|smile, a placid nature, and a slow-moving
l01-133-04|but methodical mind. For twenty years she
l01-133-05|had worked in the bottling-store at the bre-
l01-133-06|wery, and Grace heard with astonishment
l01-133-07|that Fred had known her on and off
l01-133-08|for nearly as long.
l01-143-00|It was Nick who found the answer." Only
l01-143-01|one thing for it, Mum," he said, sitting on
l01-143-02|the edge of the bed and holding one
l01-143-03|of her hands in his." Let Fred and
l01-143-04|Mag have the two upstairs rooms
l01-143-05|between them. Sam will have to
l01-143-06|come out of his kennel.
l01-157-00|He argued that it was the only place where
l01-157-01|he could be safe from Rose." See here, Sam,"
l01-157-02|Nick began." You know Fred 's getting spliced."
l01-157-03|" Gone soft in the head," Sam said." Same as
l01-157-04|I 've always said, women rule the roost and
l01-157-05|no man 's safe from 'em. Ought to be a
l01-157-06|better way of doing things. Take trees." He
l01-157-07|rattled on very happily.
l01-173-00|He propped himself on one elbow." You can't
l01-173-01|do it to me, Nick. I 've worked this room up to
l01-173-02|my way of thinking like I 'd educate a child.
l01-173-03|This room and me understands one another."
l01-173-04|" Sam," Nick said firmly," either you and
l01-173-05|me share downstairs, and we have Mag, or
l01-173-06|you stick it out up here and we all get
l01-173-07|saddled with the First Flower for ever."
l01-179-00|Sam sank back on his pillow." Oh, my
l01-179-01|God! All right, you win!" With that settled
l01-179-02|Fred was soon married. The First Flower
l01-179-03|snatched up her infant and departed, mut-
l01-179-04|tering sarcasms. The whole household
l01-179-05|listened to the dwindling screams of the
l01-179-06|baby with relief. Maggie soon proved her
l01-179-07|worth, and after a time Dan summed up
l01-179-08|the general approval by saying:
l01-187-00|" She 's as good a worker as you could wish for.
l01-187-01|She speaks our language. Mag 's one of us."
l01-187-02|Nick and his grandfather shared their bedroom
l01-187-03|amicably. The old man, though fighting a
l01-187-04|grumbling rearguard action, permitted himself
l01-187-05|gradually to become a little cleaner and
l01-187-06|tidier. In his heart he was well satisfied to
l01-187-07|have Nick's company. When they were alone
l01-187-08|together he often explained all over again
l01-187-09|how shrewd he had been in discovering
l01-187-10|Alf Jesty's secret.
l01-195-00|" Imagine it, Nick, just that bit of information
l01-195-01|Fred picked up about Pete Jesty always touching
l01-195-02|his nose, and me remembering from that
l01-195-03|snap you once showed me that this Cax-
l01-195-04|ton had some sort of a scar there. Just
l01-195-05|an idea to begin with, mind you - then
l01-195-06|click! and I 'd got it. That was smart
l01-195-07|work, say what you like."
l01-199-00|" It certainly was, Sam," Nick would agree, and go
l01-199-01|on to say with a touch of self-importance:" No
l01-199-02|wonder he tried to have me suffocated back
l01-199-03|last summer. Must have thought I 'd
l01-199-04|rumbled him right from the start." By this
l01-199-05|time Nick was certain in his own mind
l01-199-06|that he had really seen Caxton's hand
l01-199-07|snatching at the prop holding the barge's
l01-199-08|hatch open, though he could never prove it,
l01-199-09|and it would not be of much use if
l01-199-10|he could.
l03-000-00|The nose is one of the most pain-sensitive
l03-000-01|organs in the human body - and
l03-000-02|Malone was discovering the truth in
l03-000-03|scientific detail. Kennan had only
l03-000-04|seconds left. He jumped forward to
l03-000-05|the far limit of his chain, his
l03-000-06|right hand chopping edge-downwards
l03-000-07|in bone-jarring force.
l03-004-00|The blow took the writhing thug a fraction
l03-004-01|above the boney knob which landmarked the cervical
l03-004-02|plexus, the vital nerve-centre which a long-ago
l03-004-03|Marine instructor had declared the pinnacle of unarmed
l03-004-04|combat targets. The thug collapsed with a whistling
l03-004-05|moan, and Kennan tore the Luger from the man's
l03-004-06|suddenly limp hand. There was no time for
l03-004-07|rejoicing, but the hard, firm shape of the
l03-004-08|automatic sent a new confidence surging through
l03-004-09|his body.
l03-008-00|Shouts, and the clatter of feet meant
l03-008-01|Goldie and Leo Grundy were on their
l03-008-02|way. Kennan pulled the manacle chain
l03-008-03|taut, and blasted two shots at the
l03-008-04|link which tied him to the ring-bolt in
l03-008-05|the rock. The nine-millimetre bullets sma-
l03-008-06|shed the chain as if it had been plastic,
l03-008-07|and, free, though the chain still dangled,
l03-008-08|he threw himself across the floor
l03-008-09|towards the entrance.
l04-000-00|' Well, what do you think? ' she scoffed, her
l04-000-01|brilliant eyes challenging him. He made no answer.
l04-000-02|There was nothing to be said. He lifted his glass
l04-000-03|and drained it, feeling the sweat breaking out on the
l04-000-04|palms of his hands.
l04-005-00|When at last he looked up she was standing right
l04-005-01|in front of him, smiling as if nothing had happened!
l04-005-02|He could hardly believe it and blinked several times.
l04-005-03|' Well, don't I get a drink tonight? ' she asked boldly.
l04-005-04|' Of course... anything you like ', he murmured,
l04-005-05|relief flooding over him. ' Kitty... I 'm sorry.... '
l04-005-06|His throat went tight and words failed him.
l04-012-00|' Aw, forget it ', she said cheerfully. ' I 'll sting
l04-012-01|you for a double for being a naughty boy.
l04-012-02|How about the telly tomorrow afternoon? '
l04-012-03|He felt a glow of happiness steal over him.
l04-012-04|Everything was all right now, thank God. She
l04-012-05|wasn't going to break with him, after all.
l04-012-06|For the moment it was the only thing in the
l04-012-07|world that mattered.
l04-020-00|' Of course, Kitty ', he said fervently, his eyes misty
l04-020-01|behind their thick lenses. ' Well, I 'll be off now. See you
l04-020-02|tomorrow... and thank you.... ' ' So long, Bob ', she said,
l04-020-03|waving her hand to him. Harry followed him to the
l04-020-04|door, opened it for him and stood outside on the step,
l04-020-05|looking up at the sky, where a few pale stars shone
l04-020-06|between puffs of light cumulus cloud.
l04-026-00|' Nice night ', he remarked affably. ' But they forecast rain
l04-026-01|for tomorrow. ' ' Do they? ' Bone glanced up at the sky, his
l04-026-02|thoughts elsewhere. Personally, he didn't care if it rained cats
l04-026-03|and dogs and he knew that Harry didn't either. He waited,
l04-026-04|pulling on his gloves and adjusting his hat. ' Look, Bob, '
l04-026-05|Harry began, after a brief silence, ' I don't mean to
l04-026-06|butt in, but if you take my advice you 'll 'ave no
l04-026-07|more truck with 'er. '
l04-034-00|He jerked his thumb over his
l04-034-01|shoulder. ' That girl 's nothing but a load
l04-034-02|of trouble, I 'm warning you. ' ' Kitty 's
l04-034-03|all right ', Bone contradicted flatly. ' It 's
l04-034-04|her boy-friend that 's the trouble. If
l04-034-05|we could get rid of him... ' Harry
l04-034-06|nodded his grizzled head like an old
l04-034-07|hound. ' You 're right there, Bob ', he
l04-034-08|muttered. ' But it 's easier said than done.
l04-043-00|Kitty encourages him, too. No work, no
l04-043-01|background, no regular money so far as I
l04-043-02|can make out. Probably on the crook.
l04-043-03|But there you are, the girl 's wild and
l04-043-04|headstrong. I can't do nothing with 'er. '
l04-043-05|' Don't worry, Harry ', the other said quietly.
l04-043-06|' I won't make a fool of myself.
l04-043-07|Kitty needs a good friend and I 'll
l04-043-08|always be that. '
l04-052-00|He paused, hatred of Stevie Hewitt
l04-052-01|rising like gall in his throat.
l04-052-02|' And I 'll find a way of getting rid of
l04-052-03|that chap, Hewitt, too. Leave it to me. '
l04-052-04|' O.K., Bob, but watch your step. He 's
l04-052-05|a tough customer, mark my words ', Harry
l04-052-06|said in a low voice. Bone half smiled
l04-052-07|in the darkness. ' I 'll remember ', he said.
l04-052-08|' Good night, Harry. ' ' Good night, Bob. '
l04-062-00|Bone walked down the road, his cre*?
l04-062-01|5pe-soled shoes making no sound
l04-062-02|on the asphalt surface. As he walked
l04-062-03|he concentrated on the problem of
l04-062-04|Stevie Hewitt. By comparison with the
l04-062-05|manner in which he had dispatched
l04-062-06|Henry Mansell the elimination of a
l04-062-07|little spiv from Brighton seemed an
l04-062-08|easy undertaking... once he 'd set
l04-062-09|his mind to it.
l04-066-00|Back at the cottage he prepared his supper and ate
l04-066-01|it beside the fire in the living-room, his thoughts once
l04-066-02|more on Kitty. If she was really in love with Stevie
l04-066-03|Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying about her, he
l04-066-04|told himself moodily. Yet it was not as clear-cut as that.
l04-066-05|He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware
l04-066-06|of the necessity to help and protect her, even against
l04-066-07|her will.
l04-071-00|Tonight, for the first time, he had abandoned all
l04-071-01|pretence and shown her the honest desperation of his feeling
l04-071-02|for her. She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected
l04-071-03|him. In some perverse way their brief quarrel had forged
l04-071-04|a bond between them. No doubt she had every intention
l04-071-05|of keeping both of them on a string. On the whole he probably
l04-071-06|had a slight advantage over the young man, inasmuch as he
l04-071-07|had money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy
l04-071-08|respect for the material things of life.
l04-082-00|Sentence Database L04-082
l04-082-01|But he was still no sort of match for a young
l04-082-02|and virile competitor and he knew it. He turned
l04-082-03|away and begun to undress, shivering with the
l04-082-04|cold. His eye automatically glanced towards the
l04-082-05|panel which concealed the hiding-place of his
l04-082-06|secret treasure. For an instant he stood
l04-082-07|transfixed to the floor, his eyes unwavering
l04-082-08|as they riveted themselves on the wall.
l04-087-00|Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided?
l04-087-01|Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
l04-087-02|panel and pulled it out. The black tin box was exactly
l04-087-03|as he had left it. With heavily beating heart he reached
l04-087-04|out and lifted the lid. Everything was intact and he
l04-087-05|gasped with relief.
l04-093-00|He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
l04-093-01|to count them. Of course, he remembered being in a great hurry to get
l04-093-02|that fifty pounds for Kitty! Obviously he had been careless in
l04-093-03|replacing the panel, but the possibility of anyone having
l04-093-04|discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock.
l04-093-05|As he replaced the bundles of notes, he withdrew the tin
l04-093-06|box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
l04-093-07|cupboard.
l04-098-00|It would be safer under lock and key
l04-098-01|for the time being than behind a piece
l04-098-02|of panelling which did not fit very sec-
l04-098-03|urely. Tomorrow he would buy a
l04-098-04|heavy padlock for the box and search
l04-098-05|for a new hiding-place. He lay in bed,
l04-098-06|cold and uneasy, unable to account
l04-098-07|for an instinctive sense of danger.
l04-102-00|When he closed his eyes it was
l04-102-01|Henry Mansell's face he saw, hovering
l04-102-02|above his head like a hideous caricature. The
l04-102-03|parrot nose and straight line of the mouth,
l04-102-04|the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip
l04-102-05|him right down to his abjectly quaking
l04-102-06|bones. The mouldering horror that had
l04-102-07|once been Henry Mansell taunted him
l04-102-08|now in the silent darkness.
l04-106-00|In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at
l04-106-01|Hawkeshurst that Friday night Hugh Mansell and Roddy
l04-106-02|Dowell drank their beer and waited. ' It 's too damn busy
l04-106-03|in here. We can't expect him to leave his customers ',
l04-106-04|Hugh said morosely. ' Give him a chance, old chap.
l04-106-05|He 'll be over. Jim 's a most reliable chap when
l04-106-06|it comes to picking up a small tip. '
l04-113-00|' O.K., Roddy, whatever you say. ' Hugh drained his glass and
l04-113-01|ordered two more beers. ' I 'm really beginning to feel it 's
l04-113-02|all a bit of a waste of time, anyway. I 've been collecting
l04-113-03|scraps of evidence and piecing them together for four
l04-113-04|months now, and the whole lot still doesn't amount to
l04-113-05|anything one could call concrete. '
l04-118-00|Roddy puffed at his pipe, his eyes fixed on the white-coated
l04-118-01|barman. ' Oh, I think it does, Hugh. That 's
l04-118-02|why I want you to meet this bird. I think
l04-118-03|he fills in an important part of the
l04-118-04|background. Furthermore, dear boy, it confirms
l04-118-05|what we already know of your father's
l04-118-06|intention to leave the country on the night
l04-118-07|of October 14th. '
l04-124-00|Hugh nodded. His face wore the melancholy expression
l04-124-01|that was habitual to him but his eyes showed
l04-124-02|his inner excitement. ' I know, but from the
l04-124-03|moment he walked out of here we haven't a
l04-124-04|shred of evidence to prove what happened.
l04-124-05|Obviously he met someone, either by chance or
l04-124-06|by arrangement. Whichever way it was, that
l04-124-07|person had a gun and he managed to persuade
l04-124-08|Father to drive along that quiet stretch of
l04-124-09|road.... '
l04-130-00|' Miles off his proper route to Dover or the airport at
l04-130-01|Lydd ', Roddy interposed quickly. ' And once there he was
l04-130-02|shot at close range and his money smartly filched.
l04-130-03|You know, whoever it was might have known of the
l04-130-04|existence of the suicide letter... providing him with
l04-130-05|an almost unshakable alibi. ' Hugh was thinking of
l04-130-06|his uncle, but said nothing. After all, Julian had
l04-130-07|acted very strangely since the tragedy, always
l04-130-08|secretive, always reluctant to discuss his brother's
l04-130-09|death.
l04-136-00|It was impossible to associate him in one's mind with a
l04-136-01|cold-blooded murder but, in fact, Henry Mansell's
l04-136-02|death had saved the firm and Julian's future.
l04-136-03|Moreover he might well have been aware of his
l04-136-04|brother's intention to skip out of the country and
l04-136-05|passed on the information. ' I 'm sure you 're right ',
l04-136-06|Hugh said thoughtfully. ' But whoever did it got
l04-136-07|clean away without being spotted. '
l04-141-00|' Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter,
l04-141-01|believe me ', Roddy affirmed solemnly. ' He probably caught
l04-141-02|the next boat across the channel and has been lying low
l04-141-03|with the money somewhere. ' Hugh nodded. ' I realized that
l04-141-04|after my talk with Mrs. Lawford. There are a dozen countries
l04-141-05|where a man could easily hide up and change the money
l04-141-06|without danger.
l04-147-00|Unless we can get a definite line on him it 's
l04-147-01|hopeless.... ' ' Something will turn up one day, you 'll see ',
l04-147-02|Roddy said confidently. ' If we plug away at the leads
l04-147-03|we have.... ' ' If only the police would do something... ' Hugh
l04-147-04|cried out in exasperation. ' I 've put everything I know
l04-147-05|before them.... '
l04-153-00|' No dice, Hugh. ' Roddy shook his sandy head.
l04-153-01|' They 're bound to want pretty solid new evidence
l04-153-02|before they 'll agree to reopen the case. From
l04-153-03|their point of view the evidence for suicide is
l04-153-04|overwhelming. I spoke to a chap from the office of
l04-153-05|the Director of Public Prosecutions I know pretty
l04-153-06|well, and he agreed that the missing cash is
l04-153-07|a hell of a mystery.
l04-159-00|But as he quite reasonably pointed out the
l04-159-01|money could have been disposed of in London
l04-159-02|before your father left that evening. It wouldn't be
l04-159-03|unnatural for a man in his position to make provision
l04-159-04|for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded
l04-159-05|as particular debts of honour before taking his own
l04-159-06|life. Also, logically, there 's nothing to show the
l04-159-07|money couldn't have been pinched by someone
l04-159-08|passing the car after your father was dead.
l04-163-00|Stealing from cars is about the commonest
l04-163-01|kind of crime in the book. There 's nothing
l04-163-02|that absolutely ties the missing money to the
l04-163-03|circumstances of your father 's death, that 's
l04-163-04|the point. Same with the passport. It 's gone
l04-163-05|and that 's that. It may turn up in a dustbin
l04-163-06|somewhere or at the back of a drawer. As
l04-163-07|far as the police are concerned there 's nothing
l04-163-08|to go on.
l04-170-00|In our own minds we may be pretty sure what
l04-170-01|happened, but that 's not good enough for them.
l04-170-02|That suicide letter did the trick - definite proof
l04-170-03|that your father took his life, backed by
l04-170-04|medical evidence and the fingerprint chaps. '
l04-170-05|A little man with thin brown hair and a
l04-170-06|ruddy complexion came over and greeted
l04-170-07|them.
l04-174-00|He wore a short white coat. Hugh ordered drinks.
l04-174-01|' I was sorry to read about your dad in the
l04-174-02|paper ', the man said to Hugh in a thick
l04-174-03|voice which bore traces of a cockney accent.
l04-174-04|' I was telling your friend how he come
l04-174-05|in here the very night he passed away. '
l04-179-00|Hugh wasn't impressed with this ingratiating bar-
l04-179-01|man whom Roddy had raked up. He was seedy and
l04-179-02|middle-aged with small black eyes set close to-
l04-179-03|gether beneath heavily marked brows and a sly,
l04-179-04|crafty expression that failed to inspire confidence.
l04-179-05|' He was hitting the bottle pretty hard, sir... ' the
l04-179-06|man said in a loud whisper. ' Meaning no offe-
l04-179-07|nce ', he added, looking at Hugh.
l07-052-00|" Why?" he asked again." I can tell by your voice that it means
l07-052-01|a lot to you, but I 'm damned if I can see the reason. It 's not as
l07-052-02|if you were all that fond of Alice." He was interrupted by the
l07-052-03|arrival of the food and wine. When the pouring ritual was over he
l07-052-04|went on:
l07-065-00|If he didn't do it it must have been -"" Must have been
l07-065-01|who?" Max prompted. I looked into his eyes and longed
l07-065-02|with all my heart to tell him, but I could not do it.
l07-065-03|As long as my suspicion remained in my head I could pretend
l07-065-04|to myself, in moments of optimism, that it was not true.
l07-074-00|If you 're right, you may be in serious danger from Hardy.
l07-074-01|Even if you 're wrong you 'll most certainly be in danger when
l07-074-02|you start handling a boat." He picked up his glass and
l07-074-03|held it in both hands, looking at me thoughtfully over the
l07-074-04|top of it." No," he said at last." I can't allow # #
l07-074-05|it."
l07-080-00|" You can't very well stop me."" I can
l07-080-01|do better than that. If we were to
l07-080-02|get married now I could come
l07-080-03|with you." I looked down at my
l07-080-04|plate, not daring to let him see
l07-080-05|how much the idea appealed to
l07-080-06|me, reminding myself that he could
l07-080-07|only have said such a thing
l07-080-08|because he did not know the
l07-080-09|whole truth.
l07-085-00|" And I can't allow that," I said.
l07-085-01|" Deadlock," said Max." No, it isn't.
l07-085-02|I 'm determined to go, and by myself,
l07-085-03|whatever you say."" I was afraid of
l07-085-04|that." He sounded resigned but none
l07-085-05|the less hopeful." You 're a very
l07-085-06|wilful woman but I 'll change
l07-085-07|your mind for you one of these
l07-085-08|days.
l07-103-00|" You can see it any time you like,"
l07-103-01|he told me." The sooner the better.
l07-103-02|If you can get to Bletcham this
l07-103-03|evening I 'll run you up there
l07-103-04|in the car."" That 's very nice of
l07-103-05|you."" Nice, nothing. I told you,
l07-103-06|I 'm mad about boats. Seven
l07-103-07|thirty do you?
l07-111-00|I could meet you at the bus station."
l07-111-01|" No," I said," outside your office."
l07-111-02|I could not endure the thought
l07-111-03|of another wait at the bus station.
l07-111-04|He was there punctually. Dressed
l07-111-05|in a loud tartan shirt and abbreviated
l07-111-06|shorts he looked hardly more than
l07-111-07|a boy, a cheerful, good-natured
l07-111-08|boy. He settled me into the car
l07-111-09|with touching care and then
l07-111-10|drove like a fiend along
l07-111-11|the river road.
l07-118-00|Ten minutes later he stopped in a lane
l07-118-01|and helped me out with the same
l07-118-02|careful courtesy." What sort of boat is it?"
l07-118-03|I asked." She," he corrected." She 's a
l07-118-04|converted life-boat. Not a very good one,
l07-118-05|but she 's sound enough and the
l07-118-06|engine 's fine."
l07-131-00|Inside, she was untidy and grubby but
l07-131-01|roomy enough and well lit by two rows of
l07-131-02|good-sized windows. It was a long time
l07-131-03|before I got used to calling them
l07-131-04|portholes. The owner was a middle-aged
l07-131-05|man whose family had tired of the
l07-131-06|limited excitement of the river and now
l07-131-07|had their eyes on a seagoing boat.
l07-135-00|Clive - he insisted on being called Clive -
l07-135-01|haggled with him and within half an hour
l07-135-02|Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
l07-135-03|fifty pounds. When all the business details
l07-135-04|had been settled and the owner had
l07-135-05|departed with my cheque in his pocket,
l07-135-06|Clive started the engine and gave me my
l07-135-07|first lesson in manoeuvring up and down
l07-135-08|the river and in and out of the other boats.
l07-138-00|It was a warm, still evening; the plop of
l07-138-01|fish and the gentle putter of the engine
l07-138-02|were infinitely soothing after city noises,
l07-138-03|and I began to look forward to my life
l07-138-04|on the water. At last he pronounced
l07-138-05|me riverworthy and wanted to know when
l07-138-06|I would be moving in.
l07-172-00|Like Clive, he was enthusiastic about the
l07-172-01|engine and decided, apparently on the strength
l07-172-02|of its efficiency, that Sandpiper was fit to
l07-172-03|live in. I was more than thankful for his help
l07-172-04|when we had installed my things and the
l07-172-05|boat began to move. The river was crowded
l07-172-06|with flocks of sailing boats which
l07-172-07|swirled round us like gulls and there
l07-172-08|were two locks to negotiate, but Max
l07-172-09|seemed to know exactly what to do
l07-172-10|and at the same time kept me supplied
l07-176-00|" How on earth do you know all this?" I asked
l07-176-01|him." I used to play about in these things
l07-176-02|when I was a kid. And then I acted as guide
l07-176-03|on a river boat one summer, to keep myself
l07-176-04|going between terms at college." It was
l07-176-05|the first I had heard of it, but that 's
l07-176-06|one of the things I like about Max.
l07-181-00|He has done so many things that there
l07-181-01|is always something new and exciting to
l07-181-02|discover about him." You 're wonderful," I
l07-181-03|said, meaning it. He pressed the tip of my
l07-181-04|nose with one finger." That makes two of us."
l07-181-05|It was about eight o'clock in the evening
l07-181-06|when we tied up almost exactly opposite
l07-181-07|Hardy's garden and went up on to the
l07-181-08|roof of the cabin to see what we could see.
l07-187-00|From this side, Rivermead was less forbidding;
l07-187-01|it stood a long way back from the water
l07-187-02|at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
l07-187-03|flowering trees and shrubs. To the right of
l07-187-04|the lawn, close to the water's edge, stood an
l07-187-05|ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria; it
l07-187-06|was built across a narrow backwater
l07-187-07|and there was a delicate iron staircase
l07-187-08|climbing the outer wall to a room above.
l07-190-00|" You won't see anyone tonight, it 's too late," Max
l07-190-01|said and turned to go." No - wait," I put out a
l07-190-02|hand to stop him. The sun was no longer shining
l07-190-03|and it was dark across there by the trees,
l07-190-04|but I thought I had seen something move.
m01-000-00|A shudder, more mental than physical, ran
m01-000-01|through him, and his mind seemed to
m01-000-02|melt away into emptiness. His bulging
m01-000-03|eyes caught the reclining form of Heather,
m01-000-04|who was still repeating in sing-song:
m01-000-05|"... I will not give in..." He stared at her
m01-000-06|blankly, mouthing an incoherent gabble
m01-000-07|of half words.
m01-012-00|He slapped himself in the face and
m01-012-01|cuffed the sides of his head. Then
m01-012-02|by degrees the rotating objects
m01-012-03|slowed, and coming into focus took
m01-012-04|the form of the furnishings in Dan
m01-012-05|Brown's living room. He stood up un-
m01-012-06|steadily and looked about the room,
m01-012-07|trying to gather his wits. Outside the
m01-012-08|dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and
m01-012-09|the heights beyond were in
m01-012-10|silhouette, already a solid black.
m01-017-00|He bumped into a floor lamp and
m01-017-01|switched it on. Heather McNabb still lay
m01-017-02|on the couch, her body uncomfortably twisted
m01-017-03|and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks.
m01-017-04|He went to the kitchen for water and found
m01-017-05|Dan. Dan was lying on a long bench in the
m01-017-06|breakfast nook, his head bent upright
m01-017-07|against the wall.
m01-022-00|His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat,
m01-022-01|as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks
m01-022-02|brought forward. He mouthed a low mutter, punctuated at intervals
m01-022-03|with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon. As
m01-022-04|Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut,
m01-022-05|with jaws askew.
m01-026-00|There was utter imbecility in his blank face. Presently the
m01-026-01|muttering started again, and went on and on. Stunned and
m01-026-02|shaken, Steve drew a glass of water and went back to
m01-026-03|Heather. Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still
m01-026-04|trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects.
m01-026-05|For several minutes they had been facing each other across
m01-026-06|a low table, like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with
m01-026-07|each other through forced association.
m01-032-00|Then something like a zest for living began to come back
m01-032-01|to Steve and he squeezed her hand. Her face took on
m01-032-02|enough animation to produce a wan smile. Dan's low mut-
m01-032-03|tering was just audible from the kitchen. And Steve
m01-032-04|could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions
m01-032-05|she was growing cold and numb with shock. She had seen
m01-032-06|Dan, or rather the physical relic of him - the empty
m01-032-07|shell of flesh and bone, devoid of intellect and
m01-032-08|personality.
m01-038-00|And these had been his great qualities,
m01-038-01|so attractive to her. The Base Station had
m01-038-02|gone before, discharging its narrow plane of
m01-038-03|4ementalating energy along the length of
m01-038-04|the Earth's imaginary longitudes, moving
m01-038-05|eastward like a knife-edged twilight in
m01-038-06|reversed progression. It had brought the
m01-038-07|First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest,
m01-038-08|the empty-minded receptiveness that
m01-038-09|prepared the way for the Second Stage.
m01-100-00|The Thetans must not see him! He took another route
m01-100-01|to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on
m01-100-02|the way. Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at
m01-100-03|once; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss
m01-100-04|their situation, as far as it could be assessed,
m01-100-05|and to decide on what seemed to be the best
m01-100-06|way of meeting it.
