d01-016-00|The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
d01-016-01|the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
d01-016-02|plan and to the different public for which, or against which, the author wrote.
d01-016-03|The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel.
d01-019-00|There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
d01-019-01|Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations. The
d01-019-02|present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history. The
d01-019-03|original was written on a roll, or codex, which fell into disorder or was
d01-019-04|accidentally damaged. An editor, who was not the author, made what he
d01-019-05|could of the chaos by placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in order.
d01-049-00|The one real weakness of the Commentator's
d01-049-01|case is that, in common with all his colleagues,
d01-049-02|he has not, until now, been able to exhibit exactly
d01-049-03|how this enlargement was effected nor has he
d01-049-04|been able to explain the textual movements by
d01-049-05|showing that such changes are part of a
d01-049-06|simple and coherent plan. To understand how
d01-049-07|this is possible it is necessary to examine the
d01-049-08|text of the Gospel.
d01-052-00|THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
d01-052-01|written in Greek. A modern text of the
d01-052-02|Gospel represents the work of generations of
d01-052-03|scholars who have compared the many manu-
d01-052-04|scripts of John and worked out the version
d01-052-05|which is most likely to have been the original
d01-052-06|wording. It is not possible to establish any one
d01-052-07|text with absolute precision.
d01-080-00|The bar was the commonest marking, but others
d01-080-01|were also used. Dots sometimes served in place of the
d01-080-02|bar, and there are cases where spacing is used as
d01-080-03|it is now used to mark a paragraph ending. Frequently
d01-080-04|paragraphos markings were omitted. C. H. Roberts is of
d01-080-05|the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
d01-080-06|some markings would be used, although which, it is
d01-080-07|impossible to say.
d01-085-00|Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
d01-085-01|the original of the Gospel would be unmarked. The
d01-085-02|original of the Gospel, whether written on a roll or codex,
d01-085-03|whether paragraphed or not, would be laid out in
d01-085-04|columns. This is the invariable practice of ancient
d01-085-05|manuscripts. A common size of column would hold
d01-085-06|about one third of a page of Souter's print.
d01-098-00|The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
d01-098-01|and the sheet wound round this central pin. The roll made
d01-098-02|a simple and serviceable book. It was robust - the number
d01-098-03|which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
d01-098-04|this - and it was easily stored. It had two disadvantages. It
d01-098-05|was generally a single-sided form of book, and it was not
d01-098-06|an easy form of book in which to find a
d01-098-07|reference.
d01-104-00|This last objection might have had some weight in
d01-104-01|ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural History, 13. 11-12,
d01-104-02|the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making.
d01-104-03|As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01-104-04|overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79, his
d01-104-05|information is contemporaneous with the New Testament.
d01-104-06|The other form of book was the codex. In this the
d01-104-07|sheets were bound together down one edge much as
d01-104-08|they are in modern books.
d01-118-00|Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
d01-118-01|might be bulky. It is sometimes possible to tell
d01-118-02|whether or not a particular text was written on
d01-118-03|a roll or a codex. Rolls were prepared for
d01-118-04|writing, but any papyrus left unused at the
d01-118-05|end could be cut off. If the text was longer than
d01-118-06|the roll, a sheet could easily be glued on.
d01-123-00|The verso of the roll was blank, and one
d01-123-01|cannot think of an author, Mark for example,
d01-123-02|sending out his Gospel lacking the ending,
d01-123-03|while one whole side of his roll was unused.
d01-123-04|The codex form was not so accommodating. Even
d01-123-05|in the case of the single-sheet quire, an extra
d01-123-06|sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
d01-123-07|over the binding, or the whole codex rebound.
d03-117-00|A natural transition from gardens and
d03-117-01|orchards to the vital question of water
d03-117-02|supply. The pools are probably natural springs
d03-117-03|enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
d03-117-04|the rock. King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
d03-117-05|construction in lines 9, 23-25 of the Moabite Stone,
d03-117-06|which read: And I built Baal-meon and made
d03-117-07|in it the reservoir... and I made both the
d03-117-08|reservoirs for water inside the town.
d04-012-00|The word Shamir was used as a
d04-012-01|personal name ( Git. 68a). The Hebrew
d04-012-02|word" SHAMIR" means guarded or preser-
d04-012-03|ved. Therefore, the real man, who
d04-012-04|regards himself as insignificant, as the
d04-012-05|prayer says:" What am I? A worm", he
d04-012-06|is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
d04-012-07|the Shmah, loves the Lord God with
d04-012-08|all his heart, and with all his soul and
d04-012-09|with all his might and studies the
d04-012-10|word of God.
d04-016-00|This man is the worm, the creature that
d04-016-01|cuts and polishes Altar-Stones. Such
d04-016-02|a man is the Shamir that guards him-
d04-016-03|self against all the irrelevant pleasures.
d04-016-04|Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
d04-016-05|to mould our character, to melt our
d04-016-06|heart of stone. This Shamir helps
d04-016-07|us earthly creatures to build an Altar
d04-016-08|for God to come nearer to God.
d04-021-00|The action of the Shamir writes books and their
d04-021-01|books are readable. This Shamir is indeed a rare
d04-021-02|diamond that incises the hardest rock, the hardest
d04-021-03|facts. And these creatures existed from the
d04-021-04|beginning. It is" the stone, which the builders
d04-021-05|refused, but it is to become the head-stone
d04-021-06|of the corner". ( Ps. 118, 22.) And the stone shall
d04-021-07|tell!
d04-028-00|" For the stone shall cry out of the wall", like
d04-028-01|Baalam's ass," and the purlin of timber shall
d04-028-02|creak in answer" " if the roof of our security is
d04-028-03|crushing our soul" ( see Hab. 2, 10-11). And it is
d04-028-04|through the Shamir:" That the earth shall be
d04-028-05|filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
d04-028-06|Lord, as the waters cover the sea." ( Hab. 2, 14.)
d04-032-00|The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue,
d04-032-01|which is written on two plates, the hard facts
d04-032-02|of life, and all facts are" one". We have all
d04-032-03|come across human Shamirs and they leave
d04-032-04|a deep impression on our feelings and senses.
d04-032-05|They make us the Altar for God to emit
d04-032-06|the Light which can be read in every
d04-032-07|language. The Shamir is the" seventh" and
d04-032-08|most important creature, that was created on
d04-032-09|the eve of the Sabbath, to bring the
d04-032-10|Sabbath, real peace to the whole world.
d04-037-00|Then the whole earth will be His Altar." And it
d04-037-01|shall come to pass, if 1ye shall 1hearken
d04-037-02|diligently unto my commandments, which I command
d04-037-03|you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to
d04-037-04|serve Him with all your heart and with all
d04-037-05|your soul." This may seem very good, but there
d04-037-06|is something deficient.
d04-047-00|Under such conditions without putting your
d04-047-01|mind together we cannot solve the further
d04-047-02|summons of destiny, to solve the economic
d04-047-03|problems. Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
d04-047-04|Jochai ( Tanis 6a)" if Israel does not fulfil
d04-047-05|the wish of the Lord, failing to serve the
d04-047-06|Lord God with all their visionary power,
d04-047-07|the work will have to be done by each
d04-047-08|individual".
d04-050-00|They will not work in union. If physical power, spiritual power
d04-050-01|and visionary power is not united, man will remain in his heart
d04-050-02|selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
d04-050-03|gratify selfish aims, then each man will gather-in
d04-050-04|for himself only, instead of all to help to gather your
d04-050-05|corn, your wine and your oil.
d04-053-00|Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
d04-053-01|freedom from fear, fear of starvation in the
d04-053-02|midst of plenty. Help will not be easily forth-
d04-053-03|coming for the people in need. They will
d04-053-04|think of the animals first ( which is of course
d04-053-05|our duty). Of course the individual will
d04-053-06|eat and be full but:" Take heed to yourself,
d04-053-07|that your heart be not deceived, and 1ye turn
d04-053-08|aside, and serve other gods, and worship them",
d04-053-09|the yourself is thy greatest enemy, the self-
d04-053-10|seeking self.
d04-058-00|And you serve Mammon and God. And you cannot serve
d04-058-01|two masters, and you worship self-interest, isolating
d04-058-02|yourself, under such conditions the goods are your gods.
d04-058-03|" And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and he
d04-058-04|shut up the heavens, that there is no rain, and that the land
d04-058-05|yield not her fruit and lest 1ye perish quickly from off the
d04-058-06|good land which the Lord 1giveth you."
d04-062-00|For without the vision to serve the Lord your God with all
d04-062-01|your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
d04-062-02|the problem of life cannot be solved." Therefore shall 1ye lay
d04-062-03|up these my words in your heart and in your soul." The text
d04-062-04|adds and in your soul, searching your soul.
d04-066-00|And the sequence in the text is different than
d04-066-01|in the first part of the Shmah, we have first" and
d04-066-02|to bind them for a sign upon your hand, that
d04-066-03|they may be as frontlets between your eyes." First to
d04-066-04|bind them to have the vision and then" And 1ye
d04-066-05|shall teach them to your children." And as we have go-
d04-066-06|ne through the mill, we need not teach them
d04-066-07|to the children any more diligently and the
d04-066-08|children will grasp now what will befall
d04-066-09|them without visionary power.
d04-086-00|And the tsitsits had a message sealed inside the knots
d04-086-01|just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which
d04-086-02|are used on Passover, to depict the" time of our freedom".
d04-086-03|And they are ( 1) Matzo; ( 2) Bitter Herbs; ( 3) Salt-water and
d04-086-04|Charauses ( a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the
d04-086-05|appearance of mortar); and ( 4) an attitude to lean
d04-086-06|back.
d04-089-00|( 1) Matzos is deficient bread, ( LECHEM ANJO in Hebrew),
d04-089-01|so are we deficient without spiritual knowledge, and to
d04-089-02|cure our mental incapacity we should be willing
d04-089-03|to learn. Education is always the most important task.
d04-089-04|Education gives: Freedom of Speech. ( 2) Bitter Herbs
d04-089-05|symbolises the bitterness that is hurled against us.
d04-089-06|We eat it. We accept it, to show we have self-control
d04-089-07|and that God dwells within us.
d04-096-00|Self-control gives us: Freedom to worship God. ( 3) Salt Water and Charauses:
d04-096-01|the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah
d04-096-02|( MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew, Salt is the covenant of 1thy God,
d04-096-03|Levit. 2, 13.) Salt preserves and we should have this salt in
d04-096-04|ourselves and have peace with one-another. And the sweet
d04-096-05|Mortar ( the CHARAUSES in Hebrew) that binds all the" hard-
d04-096-06|facts" together and explains them, represents the Oral
d04-096-07|Tradition.
d04-101-00|We dip into both, at the Seder. And we want to understand
d04-101-01|more of the Torah and the Oral Tradition, our inheritance.
d04-101-02|Living the life of the Torah (" dipping-in") makes us
d04-101-03|meek:" But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall
d04-101-04|delight themselves in the abundance of Peace" ( Psalm 37,
d04-101-05|11). That gives us freedom from want.
d04-111-00|( 1) Matzo represents Peshat; ( 2) Moraur
d04-111-01|represents Remez; ( 3) Dipping-in represents
d04-111-02|Derush; ( 4) Leaning-back represents Saud.
d04-111-03|( This is the PARDUS.) Matzo represents
d04-111-04|the literal meaning of Pesach which
d04-111-05|is called: The Feast of Matzos. The
d04-111-06|Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual
d04-111-07|principle and this gives us" a wink" ( Remez)
d04-111-08|how to live and accept all the bitterness
d04-111-09|that is hurled against us. The Salt-water
d04-111-10|and the sweet Mortar in which we dip-in represents
d04-111-11|the richness of the Law and that we should
d04-125-00|And we answer, that the Lord our God gave us" four freedoms"
d04-125-01|without which Society cannot make progress. And we drink
d04-125-02|" four cups" to thank the Lord our God for the" four
d04-125-03|freedoms" which are Divine. There are four ways of
d04-125-04|redemption: ( 1) I will bring you out from under the
d04-125-05|burdens of Egypt. ( 2) I will rid you of their bondage.
d04-131-00|( 3) I will redeem you. ( 4) I will take you to me for a
d04-131-01|people. ( 1) I will bring you out from under the
d04-131-02|burdens of Egypt: How was it that Israel was
d04-131-03|brought out from under the burdens of Egypt?
d04-131-04|Because, they kept the Passover and they were
d04-131-05|eating Matzos in Egypt and the" Feast of Matzos"
d04-131-06|was known even to Abraham and Lot.
d05-008-00|The new century opened with James 1 ascending
d05-008-01|the throne. He was quite prepared to be
d05-008-02|tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
d05-008-03|spoiled that. The Puritans had high hopes, for
d05-008-04|James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland,
d05-008-05|but those hopes were dashed. True, a new Prayer
d05-008-06|Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
d05-008-07|derived little comfort from it.
d05-013-00|They objected to the word Absolution. So the phrase ' or
d05-013-01|the remission of sins ' was added. But Absolution remained.
d05-013-02|They objected to the word Confirmation. So the phrase
d05-013-03|' or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
d05-013-04|able to render an account of their faith according
d05-013-05|to the Catechism following ' were added. But Confirmation
d05-013-06|remained. Other changes in the Book were equally
d05-013-07|minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
d05-013-08|added to the Catechism.
d05-021-00|This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
d05-021-01|been the mood which produced the Black Rubric, for
d05-021-02|it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ, which are
d05-021-03|verily and indeed taken and received by the
d05-021-04|faithful in the Lord's Supper. ' It could hardly be more
d05-021-05|definite. It was at this time, too, that King James made
d05-021-06|himself immortal by becoming associated with
d05-021-07|a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
d05-021-08|( which was never actually authorized!).
d05-025-00|In that year Shakespeare had just turned
d05-025-01|forty and had written Hamlet two years
d05-025-02|before. Bacon was at work and Milton was
d05-025-03|just learning to read. James was followed by
d05-025-04|Charles, in whose reign came the Scottish
d05-025-05|Prayer Book in 1637. Significantly this made
d05-025-06|a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
d05-025-07|became the foster mother of some of the most
d05-025-08|important Prayer Books in the Anglican
d05-025-09|Communion.
d05-030-00|Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud,
d05-030-01|now so much nobler a figure than former historians
d05-030-02|led us to believe. Laud was enthusiastically hated
d05-030-03|by Calvinists and Puritans, and the sentiment was
d05-030-04|mutual. But Laud was no Romanizer. One of his
d05-030-05|first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
d05-030-06|the Jesuit, Fisher. But anyone who was friendly
d05-030-07|with James and Charles, the Puritans argued,
d05-030-08|was necessarily a menace.
d05-040-00|Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church?
d05-040-01|Laud made a positive approach. He set out to increase
d05-040-02|a sense of reverence. The Prayer Book was to be respected
d05-040-03|and so was the office of a bishop. Altars should be
d05-040-04|altars and not any broken down, transportable
d05-040-05|table which was handy for the most improbable uses.
d06-003-00|Even worse is to laugh. Tremendous damage may be done to a child
d06-003-01|by laughing at what are very real fears. As adults, we know
d06-003-02|that their fears are groundless, indeed to us they appear laughable,
d06-003-03|but to a child they are very real. Not that I am suggesting
d06-003-04|that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
d06-003-05|to face their fears, to see through them and come out on the
d06-003-06|other side as victors.
d06-008-00|To ridicule them only pushes them farther
d06-008-01|into themselves, so that they become
d06-008-02|unable to speak about it to anybody and
d06-008-03|the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown,
d06-008-04|the harvest of which may still be being
d06-008-05|reaped at forty or fifty. Far better to
d06-008-06|agree with a child that a particular
d06-008-07|situation is frightening, and then to face
d06-008-08|it together until the child can see how
d06-008-09|unnecessary its fears were.
d06-011-00|Because situations which may contain
d06-011-01|all the elements of fear can arise suddenly,
d06-011-02|it is a good idea to condition a child
d06-011-03|to some extent against it. To keep a child
d06-011-04|of twelve or thirteen under the
d06-011-05|impression that nothing nasty ever
d06-011-06|happens is not merely dishonest, it
d06-011-07|is unwise. As I shall suggest in a
d06-011-08|later chapter there are some situations
d06-011-09|which occur less frequently than
d06-020-00|In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
d06-020-01|should pass from Him. Jesus shows us
d06-020-02|the way to face life. To see all the latent
d06-020-03|frightening possibilities and yet by facing
d06-020-04|them and knowing God is with us and
d06-020-05|that, with Him, there is nothing that can
d06-020-06|finally defeat us. More than that, that God
d06-020-07|has something important to do with our
d06-020-08|lives and that the nearer we get to Him,
d06-020-09|the stronger we become.
d06-025-00|... Today A wonderful thought In the
d06-025-01|dawn was given... And the thought
d06-025-02|Was this: That a secret plan Is hid in
d06-025-03|my hand; That my hand is big Big,
d06-025-04|Because of the plan That God, Who
d06-025-05|dwells in my hand, Knows this
d06-025-06|secret plan, Of the things He will
d06-025-07|do for the world Using my hand.
d06-027-00|Toyohiko Kagawa. Loving Saviour, who experienced
d06-027-01|all human emotion, and whose sensitive
d06-027-02|nature knows better than we do, what it is to
d06-027-03|be really afraid, help us to know that when
d06-027-04|we face life boldly, many of the shadows are
d06-027-05|seen to be allies and not enemies and that,
d06-027-06|come what may, we are never alone when
d06-027-07|we are with Thee.
d06-037-00|To others, the long hours of the night bring
d06-037-01|only a disturbed tossing and turning
d06-037-02|which causes them to wake feeling worse
d06-037-03|than when they went to bed. We may begin
d06-037-04|to understand this a little better when we
d06-037-05|realize that tiredness itself is largely in
d06-037-06|the mind. Very few people, under normal
d06-037-07|conditions, work themselves to a standstill.
d06-041-00|The mind tires first and conveys the impression
d06-041-01|of tiredness to the body. This can be proved by
d06-041-02|noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
d06-041-03|body who feels thoroughly tired. Suppose
d06-041-04|a mother has news late at night that her
d06-041-05|child is in danger. She will undertake a
d06-041-06|journey which, an hour before, she would
d06-041-07|have declared impossible.
d06-046-00|Even more simply, test your own reactions
d06-046-01|to different situations. There are some which
d06-046-02|bring on an almost immediate feeling of
d06-046-03|tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
d06-046-04|the washing-up - while others, if they
d06-046-05|refer to something you like doing, bring a
d06-046-06|veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who
d06-046-07|is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump
d06-046-08|up with no apparent tiredness at all when
d06-046-09|her boy friend calls and go for a long walk.
d06-056-00|They drag themselves around and can become
d06-056-01|a burden to their families and their friends.
d06-056-02|Any mental confusion can cause this and
d06-056-03|the best way is probably to seek advice.
d06-056-04|As we are unable to cure our own bodies
d06-056-05|if the cause of our pain is too deep seated,
d06-056-06|so we are unable to cure our own minds,
d06-056-07|if the trouble is a complicated one
d06-056-08|involving careful and patient treatment.
d06-060-00|One of the greatest steps forward that has been
d06-060-01|made this century is the way in which illness
d06-060-02|of the mind is no longer feared or shunned,
d06-060-03|and is in fact no differently regarded than
d06-060-04|physical illness. There is, nevertheless, a
d06-060-05|great deal of tiredness which comes from
d06-060-06|no major complication but results from an
d06-060-07|inability to deal with life, especially under
d06-060-08|the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
d06-060-09|century.
d06-063-00|In the days when most people were born,
d06-063-01|lived and died within the boundaries of
d06-063-02|the village, it was not difficult for anybody
d06-063-03|to live a day at a time. Even those who
d06-063-04|held a high and responsible office lived in
d06-063-05|far greater simplicity than their successors.
d06-063-06|When news from the Continent took days,
d06-063-07|from America weeks, from the Far East,
d06-063-08|months, even a Prime Minister could go to
d06-063-09|sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
d06-063-10|be happening at the other end of England,
d06-067-00|In other ways, too, life for the ordinary
d06-067-01|individual has become so complex
d06-067-02|that it taxes the mind. Two hundred
d06-067-03|years ago, men lived and worked
d06-067-04|in one place, their lives were of one
d06-067-05|piece. Now a man may live twenty,
d06-067-06|thirty even sixty miles from his
d06-067-07|work. The only connexion is the
d06-067-08|pipeline of the railway on which they
d06-067-09|travel day by day.
d06-072-00|In many cases, their homes know little of
d06-072-01|their place of work and their associates at
d06-072-02|the office or works wonder what they
d06-072-03|are possibly like in the surroundings of their
d06-072-04|homes. It is easy, desperately easy, to lead
d06-072-05|a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
d06-072-06|planning to do so or in fact being conscious
d06-072-07|of what is going on. It is easier to live life in
d06-072-08|compartments but over the years it builds up,
d06-072-09|and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
d06-072-10|need to be handled correctly.
d06-076-00|Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life
d06-076-01|as fully as possible, without having our energy sapped by un-
d06-076-02|necessary weariness. ( a) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness.
d06-076-03|We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet '. Time
d06-076-04|after time we forget something and have to go back
d06-076-05|upstairs or down to the shops.
d06-086-00|The housewife would find life far less tiring
d06-086-01|if she made a list, followed a routine of work
d06-086-02|rather than getting from one thing to the next.
d06-086-03|The business man would find that he reached
d06-086-04|the end of the day with far less strain if
d06-086-05|he was a little more systematic. To drift
d06-086-06|aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
d06-086-07|thing else. If we would only sit down and
d06-086-08|write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
d06-086-09|be done and then work quietly through them,
d06-086-10|we would find life considerably less exhausting
d06-096-00|I am more than conscious of this. How anybody
d06-096-01|can go through the same routine day in and day
d06-096-02|out for forty years I find difficult to understand.
d06-096-03|A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
d06-096-04|commerce may be kept going - though if ever
d06-096-05|it becomes possible to work out a system
d06-096-06|of ' staggered ' hours it may do an immense
d06-096-07|amount of good over and above relieving
d06-096-08|the pressure on over-crowded trains.
d06-100-00|As it is, with so much of our life already
d06-100-01|in a predetermined groove, I would
d06-100-02|hardly like to add further to the dullness
d06-100-03|which it engenders. But I am not arguing
d06-100-04|for this. I know how much of a drag it can be
d06-100-05|and I was interested some little while
d06-100-06|ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
d06-100-07|day timetable.
d06-104-00|They only worked, of course, a five-
d06-104-01|day week so that in the first week
d06-104-02|Monday to Friday were days one
d06-104-03|to five of the timetable, the following
d06-104-04|Monday was day six and Tuesday
d06-104-05|started day one again and so on.
d06-104-06|By this means they avoided each
d06-104-07|week being the same with a pupil
d06-104-08|knowing exactly what the subject
d06-104-09|would be on Friday afternoon at
d06-104-10|3 p.m..
d06-107-00|It was a little complicated to work,
d06-107-01|of course, and there had to be a big
d06-107-02|notice in the entrance saying which
d06-107-03|day of the timetable it was - but
d06-107-04|it added immensely to the interest
d06-107-05|and kept everybody on their toes.
d06-107-06|To have order does not mean getting
d06-107-07|into a dull routine. I have great
d06-107-08|sympathy with the young wife
d06-107-09|who does not always want to do
d06-107-10|the washing on a Monday.
d06-111-00|I would not want to either, but if she wants to get through
d06-111-01|the day without becoming exhausted, she will be well advised to
d06-111-02|sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
d06-111-03|do, note the order in which they can most conveniently be
d06-111-04|done ( or must be done because of other predetermined factors
d06-111-05|- you must, for example, do your shopping on the morning of
d06-111-06|the early closing day).
d06-113-00|She will, in fact, be surprised at what peace
d06-113-01|of mind ensues. ( b) Concentrate on one
d06-113-02|thing at a time. A list or a plan enables us to
d06-113-03|put all our energies into the particular
d06-113-04|matter on hand.
d07-082-00|( Actually, the Mishnah quotes two further proof
d07-082-01|texts and the Gemara explains why these,
d07-082-02|too, are necessary, but a careful examination
d07-082-03|of that passage makes it clear that these are
d07-082-04|not quoted here because they are not
d07-082-05|necessary to prove the point made by
d07-082-06|R. Joshua b. Levi.) Finally, we note that
d07-082-07|the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
d07-082-08|elsewhere.
d07-085-00|From the above it follows that here, once again,
d07-085-01|we have a good illustration of how a
d07-085-02|sugya has been fashioned from material
d07-085-03|already in the hands of the Redactors.
d07-085-04|The sugya is built around the saying of
d07-085-05|R. Joshua b. Levi. The proof text for the
d07-085-06|reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
d07-085-07|with the comment given by Samuel.
d07-089-00|( This is probably to be understood as a well-
d07-089-01|known comment on the verse; quoted by
d07-089-02|Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
d07-089-03|by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
d07-089-04|Levi's thesis!) The proof text of greeting by
d07-089-05|the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah.
d07-089-06|There is no reference to the Mishnah here
d07-089-07|because the Mishnah deals with the
d07-089-08|actual practice of greeting by the divine
d07-089-09|Name and the Gemara here quotes the
d07-089-10|texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi.
d07-093-00|The question and answer with regard to the
d07-093-01|need for the text of the angel are quoted
d07-093-02|here in the same words in which they are
d07-093-03|quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah.
d07-093-04|This can either mean that both sugyas are
d07-093-05|quoting a well-known question and
d07-093-06|answer or that our sugya is quoting from
d07-093-07|the longer sugya which deals with all
d07-093-08|four texts quoted in the Mishnah.
d07-096-00|Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
d07-096-01|original question and answer and this is quoted
d07-096-02|in the other sugya. ( This can be supported by the
d07-096-03|use of the expression: ' Boaz did it of his own
d07-096-04|accord but there was no approval of his action
d07-096-05|in Heaven ' in both sugyoth. Such an
d07-096-06|expression appears to have been framed in
d07-096-07|response to the particular point at issue here,
d07-096-08|whether the Heavenly Court concurred
d07-096-09|in the decision of the human court.)
d07-100-00|The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
d07-100-01|is then quoted and the interpretation of the
d07-100-02|latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
d07-100-03|is added, not because this is at all relevant
d07-100-04|to the discussion but because it was
d07-100-05|a familiar interpretation which had
d07-100-06|become so well known that it was
d07-100-07|invariably quoted whenever the verse
d07-100-08|itself was quoted, almost as if it were a
d07-100-09|part of the verse.
d07-102-00|The Gemara continues with a saying of the
d07-102-01|Palestinian teacher, R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent.):
d07-102-02|' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places:
d07-102-03|the court of Shem, the court of Samuel of Ramah,
d07-102-04|and the court of Solomon. ' The place of this
d07-102-05|saying here is obvious, it follows naturally
d07-102-06|on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
d07-102-07|deals with a similar theme.
e01-055-00|One can remember with horror the pictures of the
e01-055-01|overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
e01-055-02|complete with heavy crochet antimacassars, mantel-
e01-055-03|piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
e01-055-04|numerous other crocheted pieces. It was some years
e01-055-05|after the Victorian period that designers realised
e01-055-06|the potentialities of the craft, and crochet was
e01-055-07|revived with designs suitable for contemporary
e01-055-08|trends. Crochet today has a variety of uses, and
e01-055-09|has even stepped into the field of high fashion.
e06-000-00|This could hardly happen without the
e06-000-01|herring having some orientation with the
e06-000-02|sea bottom. It means that the crowding
e06-000-03|is caused during the daytime, and that
e06-000-04|the herring must continue to migrate over
e06-000-05|the ground as well as in midwater and
e06-000-06|during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
e06-000-07|is always from the north).
e06-003-00|Thus we can see that herring
e06-003-01|movements, although primarily
e06-003-02|instinctive perhaps, and certainly
e06-003-03|helped and hindered by water flow,
e06-003-04|are also closely related to the sea-bed
e06-003-05|geography. Geography, too, names the
e06-003-06|great fisheries that depend on them:
e06-003-07|the Fladen Ground ( where again most big
e06-003-08|shots are taken on the edges), the Gut,
e06-003-09|a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
e06-003-10|the herring spawn along the northern
e06-010-00|In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom.
e06-010-01|Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure. But
e06-010-02|they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side, or westerly, until
e06-010-03|in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
e06-010-04|echo-sounders. Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
e06-010-05|their optimum depth; and this coincides with the suitable
e06-010-06|gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
e06-010-07|spawning herring are always found.
e06-015-00|The joint evidence of echo-sounders
e06-015-01|and fishing gear leads to an overall
e06-015-02|though somewhat dim picture.
e06-015-03|The details are harder still to see.
e06-015-04|Drift Effects. At East Anglia, for instance,
e06-015-05|shoals that gather at the Knoll or
e06-015-06|other banks are most of them
e06-015-07|going to travel a hundred
e06-015-08|miles farther south before they
e06-015-09|spawn. Some will spawn at the
e06-021-00|So the arrival of any particular shoal
e06-021-01|fish at a certain spawning ground may
e06-021-02|be accidental. Yet there will always be some
e06-021-03|that find it if enough are travelling, just as
e06-021-04|the robin who gets back exactly may be
e06-021-05|only one among thousands who do not.
e06-021-06|But this southerly migration is not
e06-021-07|accidental. Being contranatant or against
e06-021-08|the drift, it probably has a survival value
e06-021-09|in ensuring that the fry after hatching
e06-021-10|are drifted back into the normal home
e06-026-00|Drift in another form probably
e06-026-01|explains how these migrating herring
e06-026-02|are biased to east or west by the
e06-026-03|different winds. Strong westerlies
e06-026-04|are well known to bring good
e06-026-05|longshore fishings. The surface
e06-026-06|water that is blown offshore must
e06-026-07|be replaced by an underflow bringing
e06-026-08|with it the herring to the Norfolk
e06-026-09|and Suffolk beaches.
e06-030-00|Easterly winds, on the other hand,
e06-030-01|mean no herring along the shore, as
e06-030-02|recent years have shown. A succession
e06-030-03|of winds is needed for this effect of
e06-030-04|course - one breeze will not do it,
e06-030-05|though a very hard westerly will
e06-030-06|often start off the" local" herring;
e06-030-07|but quite apart from this wind effect
e06-030-08|there is an easterly drift special
e06-030-09|to this rump of coastline, caused by
e06-030-10|the meeting of water from north and south.
e06-033-00|Herring fishermen call this" the outset". It
e06-033-01|is strongest at spring tides, when without
e06-033-02|wind you will" set" out - or drift to the east-
e06-033-03|ward, the length of half a fleet of nets -
e06-033-04|almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
e06-033-05|Knoll. Without an explanation of how it
e06-033-06|works, it may well be that this outset, akin
e06-033-07|to the mouth of a great salmon river, has
e06-033-08|been the biggest factor through the ages
e06-033-09|in the constancy of this great herring fishery.
e06-046-00|( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved; it may
e06-046-01|be by actual contact, or by sight reaction to the disturbed
e06-046-02|sand; or even in the case of flat fish, by vibrations
e06-046-03|through or along the bottom.) But given such a bow
e06-046-04|wave of disturbance, it is obvious that without something
e06-046-05|to overcome its effect, very few fish would be caught.
e06-049-00|Let us consider first what would
e06-049-01|appear to be the simplest case -
e06-049-02|that of flat fish on the bottom.
e06-049-03|The evidence suggest that the fish are
e06-049-04|aware of the moving footrope before
e06-049-05|it reaches them. They move away before
e06-049-06|it, swimming at the same speed
e06-049-07|for an unknown period of time, until
e06-049-08|they become ( 1) tired, or ( 2) more used
e06-049-09|to the disturbance.
e06-053-00|Then they stop swimming and are caught. In
e06-053-01|the seine-net film this usually seemed to
e06-053-02|happen just after the fish had risen above
e06-053-03|the footrope, and presumably out of its
e06-053-04|field of disturbance, or bow wave. This suggests
e06-053-05|that the wave might be transmitted by the
e06-053-06|sea-bed, though the footrope in this case
e06-053-07|was actually just off the bottom and was
e06-053-08|indeed passing over some fish.
e06-070-00|Actually the seine net has little or no cover.
e06-070-01|And in this film the rise of the fish was
e06-070-02|small, a matter of a foot or two. With round
e06-070-03|fish like haddock, which would hardly
e06-070-04|find safety on the bottom, this cover
e06-070-05|would seem to be even more essential;
e06-070-06|but more films are needed to prove this.
e06-070-07|Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
e06-070-08|essential to catch round fish whose
e06-070-09|reaction to disturbance would be upwards.
f04-032-00|They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours, so-
f04-032-01|me well meant, some mischievous, including one that a
f04-032-02|man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
f04-032-03|the Thursday evening, with blood actually dripping from
f04-032-04|his hands. The inquest was opened on February 17, but,
f04-032-05|beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
f04-032-06|the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
f04-032-07|in which she had died, there was nothing on
f04-032-08|which to proceed, and the inquest was
f04-032-09|adjourned.
f04-035-00|Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
f04-035-01|trails. It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
f04-035-02|money to her relatives, and her brother-in-law was asked for
f04-035-03|a detailed account of his movements on the 11th. The dead
f04-035-04|woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
f04-035-05|named Brown.
f04-039-00|This man agreed that his engagement had
f04-039-01|been broken off after one particular
f04-039-02|tiff, but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
f04-039-03|money. All the while the police were casting about
f04-039-04|for a man who had been seen leaving the train
f04-039-05|at Wandsworth. A passenger described this individual
f04-039-06|as a man of about thirty, of medium height, with
f04-039-07|a dark moustache, and wearing a frockcoat
f04-039-08|and a top-hat.
f04-043-00|The porter at the station bore out this
f04-043-01|description, but the man was not traced.
f04-043-02|Perhaps the news of their search got around,
f04-043-03|for a man did obligingly present himself
f04-043-04|at Wandsworth police-station, claiming to have
f04-043-05|committed the murder - but he was mentally
f04-043-06|defective, and, despite his claim to infamy,
f04-043-07|had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening.
f04-053-00|And so the inquest, which had dragged on, with
f04-053-01|adjournments, until April 7, finally had to be content to return
f04-053-02|a verdict of" wilful murder against some person or
f04-053-03|persons unknown." The most vital clue of the Wedgwood
f04-053-04|pestle had been of no assistance. The killer must
f04-053-05|have been very thankful that the science of
f04-053-06|dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings.
f04-057-00|The next female fatality occurred eight years later,
f04-057-01|yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
f04-057-02|a further seven years before even a ghost of a
f04-057-03|solution emerged. There has always been something
f04-057-04|sinister in the idea of tunnels. The building of
f04-057-05|them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
f04-057-06|nected with railway construction; and there
f04-057-07|were many people who believed that to travel
f04-057-08|through tunnels would be an equally
f04-057-09|hazardous business.
f04-061-00|Some thought that the result would be all
f04-061-01|sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
f04-061-02|confined atmosphere." The shareholders who travel
f04-061-03|by it will be so heartily sick, what with the
f04-061-04|foul air, smoke and sulphur, that the mention
f04-061-05|of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha,"
f04-061-06|wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
f04-061-07|proposed to build the Box Tunnel.
f04-064-00|The mere thought of subterranean travel
f04-064-01|gave others a feeling of danger. A medical journal
f04-064-02|said," the deafening peal of thunder, the sudden
f04-064-03|immersion in gloom, and the clash of reverberated
f04-064-04|sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
f04-064-05|momentary shudder, or idea of destruction, a thrill
f04-064-06|of annihilation." It was also prophesied that
f04-064-07|passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
f04-064-08|darkness.
f04-068-00|For all that, as far as England is concerned,
f04-068-01|there have been only two occasions on
f04-068-02|which a body has been found in a tunnel
f04-068-03|in circumstances pointing to murder.
f04-068-04|The first was that of Mr Gold, in the famous
f04-068-05|Lefroy case, and by an odd chance the second tragedy
f04-068-06|occurred on the same line, although this time the
f04-068-07|victim was a woman.
f04-071-00|Though in the minds of most people there was
f04-071-01|no doubt that the woman had been the victim
f04-071-02|of foul play, the verdict brought in was that there
f04-071-03|was not sufficient evidence to show whether
f04-071-04|she had fallen or been thrown from a train.
f04-071-05|The Merstham Tunnel, on the London-to-
f04-071-06|Brighton line, is approximately one mile long,
f04-071-07|and some time before midnight on September
f04-071-08|24, 1905, a Sunday, Sub-Inspector Peacock, of
f04-071-09|the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway,
f04-074-00|It was the battered and broken body of a woman.
f04-074-01|He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
f04-074-02|Station, and a stretcher party took the body to
f04-074-03|the Feathers Hotel to await identification.
f04-074-04|Was it a case of suicide, where some unhappy soul
f04-074-05|had walked deliberately into the blackness and
f04-074-06|into the path of some train? This hardly seemed
f04-074-07|likely, since, when she was examined by a local
f04-074-08|doctor, the woman, young, small, and rather plump,
f04-074-09|was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
f04-074-10|almost tight enough to strangle her, and the ends
f04-074-11|thrust in her mouth like a gag.
f04-079-00|Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising,
f04-079-01|and there were other injuries on her body which had
f04-079-02|occurred before her death was ensured by some
f04-079-03|train which had roared through the tunnel. There were
f04-079-04|no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
f04-079-05|fication, no money, and no railway ticket. By then
f04-079-06|reports were being gathered about all traffic over
f04-079-07|this stretch of line, but no information was
f04-079-08|forthcoming about any carriage with an open
f04-079-09|door, nor any passenger reporting an incident
f04-079-10|which might relate.
f04-083-00|So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
f04-083-01|long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
f04-083-02|remained a mystery until later the following day.
f04-083-03|During that time a description of the girl was
f04-083-04|circulated, and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
f04-083-05|identify her as his sister, Mary Money, aged twenty-two.
f04-083-06|The girl, who was described as being" always bright and
f04-083-07|jolly," had been unmarried, and lived at Lavender Hill,
f04-083-08|Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for
f04-083-09|whom she worked as a book-keeper.
f04-087-00|On the Sunday, the day of her death, she had gone out in the
f04-087-01|evening at about seven o'clock, telling her room-mate, Emma
f04-087-02|Hone, that she was going for a walk, but would not be
f04-087-03|gone for long. According to Miss Hone, she had not been
f04-087-04|carrying a handbag, but she believed she had had a small
f04-087-05|purse.
f07-000-00|SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000-01|told us that there was nothing an En-
f07-000-02|glishman would not do; nothing an Ame-
f07-000-03|rican would not say; nothing an
f07-000-04|Italian would not sing; no music
f07-000-05|to which the Frenchman would not
f07-000-06|dance; nothing the German would
f07-000-07|not covet; and nothing the Chinese
f07-000-08|would not eat.
f07-000b-00|SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000b-01|told us that there was nothing an Englishman
f07-000b-02|would not do; nothing an American would not
f07-000b-03|say; nothing an Italian would not sing; no
f07-000b-04|music to which the Frenchman would not dance;
f07-000b-05|nothing the German would not covet; and
f07-000b-06|nothing the Chinese would not eat.
f07-002-00|It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum.
f07-002-01|Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
f07-002-02|the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
f07-002-03|borrowed straight from the prehistoric. How
f07-002-04|many centuries ago, in some cave or hilly
f07-002-05|hide, did our forebears home from the chase
f07-002-06|hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
f07-002-07|meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
f07-002-08|homely and protecting flame.
f07-006-00|How many centuries later did the mercenary in
f07-006-01|the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
f07-006-02|evening meal. Later came the thrifty peasant,
f07-006-03|later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
f07-006-04|in Paris, and even later our attractive young
f07-006-05|ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
f07-006-06|gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants.
f07-009-00|And, if certain dishes and modes of food have
f07-009-01|persisted down the ages, the motive that preserved
f07-009-02|them has always been the same. Apart from the need
f07-009-03|for nourishment, the instinct of hospitality has
f07-009-04|always been strong in mankind. The sharing of
f07-009-05|a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
f07-009-06|admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
f07-009-07|important than the casual meetings of the present
f07-009-08|day; the desire to share something more intimate
f07-009-09|than mere converse has always been there.
f07-013-00|The truth is that good food offers a
f07-013-01|programme of entertainment almost
f07-013-02|unlimited in its variety and its presen-
f07-013-03|tation affords an opportunity of
f07-013-04|showing a guest something of ourselves.
f07-013-05|It is a far enough cry from the primitive
f07-013-06|meal-times of a simpler world to the
f07-013-07|banquets of later days, when the table
f07-013-08|groaned under its load of complicated
f07-013-09|dishes, and for all the blossoming of the
f07-013-10|arts around them the diners were little
f07-016-00|There was always the spice of an orgy
f07-016-01|in those Roman feasts, for instance, with
f07-016-02|all their peacocks and nightingales'
f07-016-03|tongues; unreasonable surfeit, too, in the
f07-016-04|elaborate fashion of eating brought
f07-016-05|out of Italy into France, we are told,
f07-016-06|by Catherine de Medici. The peasant in
f07-016-07|those days, as ever, ate sparingly, but
f07-016-08|generously enough in his own fashion,
f07-016-09|save at feast times, when he, too, let
f07-016-10|himself go; and it was from his simpler
f07-019a-00|Epicures and gourmands, sated by the unending
f07-019a-01|procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
f07-019a-02|of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
f07-019a-03|grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
f07-019a-04|the dishes of the country, and, instead of gorging the
f07-019a-05|eye with magnitude, began to understand the value of
f07-019a-06|intelligent selection and comparative simplicity, though
f07-019a-07|nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
f07-019a-08|monstrous.

f07-021a-01|water and food? The ancient Britons, I believe, used to
f07-021a-02|make water hot by dropping a red-hot poker into it,
f07-021a-03|because their pots would not stand fire; but Jacob
f07-021a-04|must have had one that would, because Esau sold
f07-021a-05|his birthright to him for a mess of pottage - and
f07-021a-06|then we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt after
f07-021a-07|which the Israelites sighed.

f07-024a-00|Anyhow, Homer does not seem to have known any
f07-024a-01|way of cooking meat except by roasting and boiling.
f07-024a-02|When Achilles gave a royal feast the principal dish
f07-024a-03|was a grill, which he cooked himself, and he knew
f07-024a-04|how to do it, too: - When the languid flames at
f07-024a-05|length subside, He throws a bed of glowing
f07-024a-06|embers wide; Above the coals the smoking
f07-024a-07|fragment turns, And sprinkles sacred salt from
f07-024a-08|lifted urns
f07-024b-00|Anyhow, Homer does not seem to have
f07-024b-01|known any way of cooking meat
f07-024b-02|except by roasting and boiling. When
f07-024b-03|Achilles gave a royal feast the principal

f07-024b-09|turns, And sprinkles sacred salt
f07-024b-10|from lifted urns.
f07-028a-00|When, however, the Greeks did learn the art of making
f07-028a-01|fireproof earthenware from the Egyptians, their cookery
f07-028a-02|made rapid progress, because they were men of taste
f07-028a-03|and intellect. A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets
f07-028a-04|of the ancient world was the fact that they did not
f07-028a-05|confine the resources of the table to the gratification
f07-028a-06|of one sense alone. Having exhausted their invention
f07-028a-07|in the preparation of stimulants for the palate,
f07-028a-08|they broke fresh ground and called another sense
f07-028a-09|to their aid.
f07-032a-00|By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled
f07-032a-01|perfumes, these refined voluptuaries aroused the
f07-032a-02|fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and
f07-032a-03|ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the
f07-032a-04|board. The gratification of the sense of smelling
f07-032a-05|was a subject of no little importance to the Romans.
f07-032a-06|They considered flowers as forming a very essential
f07-032a-07|article in their festal preparations; and it is the
f07-032a-08|opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the
f07-032a-09|number of flowers far exceeded the number
f07-032a-10|of fruits.
f07-039a-00|According to Pliny, and others, certain herbs
f07-039a-01|and flowers proved of sovereign power
f07-039a-02|clarifying the functions of the brain. It
f07-039a-03|is said that there is nothing new under
f07-039a-04|the sun, but regarding foodstuffs the
f07-039a-05|traveller occasionally encounters a certain
f07-039a-06|measure of novelty.
f07-042a-00|In China, for instance, dried rats are esteemed
f07-042a-01|a delicacy. The visitor is told that
f07-042a-02|they restore the hair of the bald and that
f07-042a-03|a stewed black rat will ward off a fever.
f07-042a-04|A number of newly-born white mice served
f07-042a-05|alive, dipped in treacle and swallowed
f07-042a-06|like a prairie oyster is considered a
f07-042a-07|piece of resistance.
f07-046a-00|Among the natives of Northern Australia lizards
f07-046a-01|roasted on the point of a spear are
f07-046a-02|definitely a delicacy while Mediterranean
f07-046a-03|peoples have a high opinion of the octopus
f07-046a-04|as an article of diet. So have the Japanese
f07-046a-05|and the Chinese. The Celestials, apart
f07-046a-06|from eating it fresh, squash it, press
f07-046a-07|it and dry it, in which form, dusted
f07-046a-08|over with flour, you will find a stack
f07-046a-09|of it in almost any provision shop.
f07-069-00|Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament
f07-069-01|than is customarily imagined as well as entering human
f07-069-02|activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed.
f07-069-03|We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
f07-069-04|one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
f07-069-05|which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years.
f07-069-06|If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red
f07-069-07|with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation,
f07-069-08|Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which
f07-069-09|provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant
f07-073-00|The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener
f07-073-01|Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with
f07-073-02|aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious
f07-073-03|fire, aerian creams, ingenious pastries and a
f07-073-04|crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by a pastry cook to
f07-073-05|celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683. Spanish
f07-073-06|cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights, of Spanish dancing
f07-073-07|and of Goja: it is vivid, highly coloured, sometimes
f07-073-08|Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour, with
f07-073-09|streaks of poetry, meat disguised under heavy and vehement
f07-076a-00|The Czechoslovak kitchen, again, is
f07-076a-01|so languorous, so passionate, and
f07-076a-02|possibly comparable alone to a gypsy
f07-076a-03|melody. The paprika and caraway perfume
f07-076a-04|the meats with their antithesis. The
f07-076a-05|opulent varieties of Czechoslovak past-
f07-076a-06|ries recall in fact the rich heritage
f07-076a-07|of rich embroideries and costumes
f07-076a-08|specifically national. The art and
f07-076a-09|science of cookery, however, is
f07-076a-10|essentially French, and, irrespective of
f07-081a-00|The French have an inborn appreciation
f07-081a-01|of good food and the gusto which they
f07-081a-02|derive from gastronomy is intellectual
f07-081a-03|and aesthetic as well as physical.
f07-081a-04|There is the same finesse about their
f07-081a-05|feeding, the same subtle delicacy of
f07-081a-06|touch, the same unfailing sense of
f07-081a-07|proportion as exists among her
f07-081a-08|writers, music composers and other
f07-081a-09|exponents of things that are
f07-081a-10|typically French.
f07-096-00|Wagner was a highly practical feeder. He ate very fast,
f07-096-01|placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as
f07-096-02|he talked. Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe
f07-096-03|which he washed down with beer. A writer who had dinner
f07-096-04|with Dickens says the menu was Whitstable oysters, a brown
f07-096-05|sole, a baked leg of mutton with oyster & veal stuffing and a
f07-096-06|gin punch.

g01-004-00|It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
g01-004-01|Londoners, but it brought heavy censure from nobles
g01-004-02|who still believed that they had a monopoly of
g01-004-03|leadership. But, at last, Gaunt sailed. Opposing
g01-004-04|him was the French Admiral, Jean de Vienne -
g01-004-05|a great sailor and an able strategist.
g01-008-00|Obedient to the policy of his King, de Vienne avoided
g01-008-01|trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
g01-008-02|on land. Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
g01-008-03|an elusive foe, and, afraid to return home without
g01-008-04|something to show, he foolishly attempted to besiege
g01-008-05|the well-protected fortress of St Malo. This
g01-008-06|involved the dreary method of mining operations in
g01-008-07|which Gaunt, under the Black Prince, had shown
g01-008-08|considerable skill at the siege of Limoges.
g01-012-00|When all seemed to be going well, a sortie surprised
g01-012-01|moment had charge of the mine; the mine collapsed
g01-012-02|fame and glory. Gaunt was compelled to return
g01-012-03|even despised failure. The ' ribald ' Londoners, who
g01-012-04|Hawley, were also expressing their disappointment
g01-012-05|comparing the failure of a subsidized duke
g01-012-06|citizen.
g01-016-00|These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
g01-016-01|obvious morals for those who are judges long
g01-016-02|after the event. It seems obvious that, though
g01-016-03|the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
g01-016-04|plate and mail of French knights, a brilliant
g01-016-05|battle was no substitute for a sound policy,
g01-016-06|and that, if archers had no target, campaigns
g01-016-07|became mere marauding route marches.
g01-019-00|It seems obvious that if an expedition to
g01-019-01|Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais,
g01-019-02|then the primary essential to the success
g01-019-03|of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
g01-019-04|command of the Channel. It seems obvious
g01-019-05|that divided forces were dissipating the
g01-019-06|advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
g01-019-07|Calais, Cherbourg, Brest, Bordeaux and Bayonne,
g01-019-08|and that there was no hope of final victory
g01-019-09|without a large-scale and concentrated invasion.
g01-025-00|In this cruel process which was
g01-025-01|hammering out nations on the anvils of
g01-025-02|war, there was a constant stirring of
g01-025-03|those in authority to find some simple
g01-025-04|way out of the complicated financial
g01-025-05|6impasse which always resulted, and in the
g01-025-06|story of the experiments and expedients
g01-025-07|to which the Exchequer resorted is
g01-025-08|the story of the prelude to the
g01-025-09|Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
g01-027-00|In appreciating this story, modern con-
g01-027-01|ceptions of governmental duties must be
g01-027-02|set aside. A modern government needs
g01-027-03|taxation not merely for defence and
g01-027-04|offence but for a very wide range of
g01-027-05|social services. A mediaeval oligarchy
g01-027-06|needed taxation in order to supplement
g01-027-07|the private wealth of the monarchy
g01-027-08|( the royal income from the revenues of
g01-027-09|crown lands, the fees of feudalism
g01-031-00|Social service as a function of government
g01-031-01|was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
g01-031-02|substitute was the mutual self-help of
g01-031-03|communities, whether those communities were
g01-031-04|monasteries, manors, townships, or wards and
g01-031-05|guilds of a city. A mediaeval tax was
g01-031-06|therefore in essence a forced payment whose
g01-031-07|return was the uncertain bounty of booty
g01-031-08|and the vague advantages of military glory;
g01-031-09|it was therefore always granted grudgingly
g01-031-10|and coupled with the vain hope that, in the
g01-034-00|When ' his ' war did not bring victory and
g01-034-01|booty, a new group of Lords might oust
g01-034-02|the unsuccessful leaders, and the Commons,
g01-034-03|who usually supplied the hard cash, might
g01-034-04|be bold enough to demand the production of
g01-034-05|accounts, and even at times the impeachment of
g01-034-06|the unsuccessful. But the Commons were not
g01-034-07|the people, and even a full Parliament was
g01-034-08|not yet a true mirror of the nation.
g01-037-00|The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's
g01-037-01|' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the
g01-037-02|feudal obligations of work or villeins who
g01-037-03|had bought their release, free labourers
g01-037-04|who worked for the highest bidders, free
g01-037-05|yeomen who had prospered enough to become
g01-037-06|successful farmers, the artisans, craftsmen,
g01-037-07|journeymen and small tradesmen of the
g01-037-08|towns, and the retainers and men-at-arms
g01-037-09|in the pay of landed Lords.
g01-039-00|None of these classes, except the yeomen, paid or
g01-039-01|expected to pay direct taxes. During the four-
g01-039-02|teenth century, the traditional methods of
g01-039-03|financing the Exchequer had become stabilized.
g01-039-04|When the King and his Council required additio-
g01-039-05|nal funds, they were usually granted an
g01-039-06|export tax on the wool trade, collected by
g01-039-07|means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that
g01-039-08|prices, quality and tax could be efficiently su-
g01-039-09|pervised and controlled, together with a
g01-043-00|There were two other sources of public revenue -
g01-043-01|first, the Church, which wisely followed the lead
g01-043-02|of the Commons and in its own Convocations
g01-043-03|granted equivalent contributions, and second,
g01-043-04|the foreign merchants, with whom the King's
g01-043-05|officials had formerly made private bargains
g01-043-06|at ' colloquies of merchants ', and whose
g01-043-07|payments were now authorized by parliamentary
g01-043-08|sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
g01-043-09|excess of the rate for native merchants.
g01-045-00|In addition to these revenues, the King had the
g01-045-01|financial benefits of his position at the head
g01-045-02|of the feudal system, as its chief landowner
g01-045-03|and the recipient of the fines of royal justice.
g01-045-04|It was, therefore, a complicated and not very
g01-045-05|satisfactory financial system in which the
g01-045-06|borders between private and public purse were
g01-045-07|as ill-defined as the borders between private
g01-045-08|and national war, and in which the comparati-
g01-045-09|vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
g01-067-00|But this time there was a very interesting
g01-067-01|attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
g01-067-02|payments demanded. The definition of an
g01-067-03|adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ',
g01-067-04|and, where the poorest were to pay a groat,
g01-067-05|the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
g01-067-06|of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks,
g01-067-07|and between these two extremes a graduated
g01-067-08|scale of payments was fixed for the
g01-067-09|different classes of laymen and clerics.
g01-070-00|Again the resentment was widespread and
g01-070-01|the results disappointing - a tax estimated
g01-070-02|to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000.
g01-070-03|In the following year, 1380, the last and
g01-070-04|most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
g01-070-05|by a Parliament which met at Northampton.
g01-070-06|There were dark reasons for a meeting so
g01-070-07|far away from the capital in a town with
g01-070-08|poor communications and not over supplied
g01-070-09|with hostelries and lodgings.
g01-074-00|London was again in turmoil; but this time
g01-074-01|over a question of trade rivalry. A rich mer-
g01-074-02|chant from Genoa had been murdered, and
g01-074-03|John de Kyrkby, a Londoner, was one of
g01-074-04|those charged with the crime. It is clear
g01-074-05|from the chronicles that this was a sordid
g01-074-06|quarrel between monopolists and interlopers.
g01-074-07|The city merchants were jealous of foreign
g01-074-08|merchants who could tempt court and
g01-074-09|baronage with rarer luxuries than those
g01-088-00|Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
g01-088-01|arithmetic which argued that, as the first
g01-088-02|poll-tax had supplied 22,000, a tax of
g01-088-03|three times the rate would produce 66,000.
g01-088-04|The only concession made in view of the
g01-088-05|objections to the first two poll-taxes was
g01-088-06|the suggestion that the rich should help
g01-088-07|the poor - but this was only a pious hope
g01-088-08|because no machinery was provided for
g01-088-09|carrying it into effect, and a subordinate
g02-059-00|In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements
g02-059-01|from the dissection of living animals, showing how these move-
g02-059-02|ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals
g02-059-03|or in flagging warmer ones. At the time of its movement
g02-059-04|the heart becomes generally constricted, its walls thicken,
g02-059-05|its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
g02-059-06|content of blood, appearing paler in so doing in animals
g02-059-07|such as serpents, frogs, and the like.
g02-062-00|At one and the same time, therefore, occur the beat
g02-062-01|of the apex, the thickening of the heart walls, and
g02-062-02|the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the
g02-062-03|contraction of the ventricles. Going on in Chapter Three
g02-062-04|to the movement of the arteries, likewise gauged from
g02-062-05|the dissections of living animals, Harvey noted that
g02-062-06|contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
g02-062-07|systole, simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries
g02-062-08|and of the artery-like vein, and expulsion of the
g02-062-09|ventricular content.
g02-065-00|Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of
g02-065-01|ventricular contraction. During cutting or puncture of
g02-065-02|the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion
g02-065-03|of blood from the wound. Arterial diastole is
g02-065-04|thus synchronous with cardiac systole but,
g02-065-05|when movement of blood through arteries is
g02-065-06|hindered by compression, infarction or inter-
g02-065-07|ception, the more distal arteries pulsate
g02-065-08|less because their pulse is nothing other
g02-065-09|than the impulse of the blood entering them.
g02-073-00|' And while the heart is slowly dying,
g02-073-01|one can sometimes see it - so to speak
g02-073-02|- rouse itself and, in reply to two or
g02-073-03|three auricular beats, produce a single
g02-073-04|ventricular one slowly and
g02-073-05|reluctantly and with an effort. '

g03-000-05|said so. Being a craftsman and a skilled man,

g03-000-07|would have nothing to do with him, others

g03-032-01|One of the helpful by-products was that
g03-032-02|they were able to obtain some respectable
g03-032-03|clothing, with which they wore a white tie
g03-032-04|and Red Flag badge, thus presenting a much

g03-043-00|One of the students was young

g03-049-00|Although his ideas were diametrically opposed
g03-049-01|to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well

g03-049-03|Conrad Noel, the eloquent leader of
g03-049-04|the Church Socialist League, genuinely advocated
g03-049-05|socialism. With such men, who had the

g03-049-07|Christianity, common ground could be found.

g04-022-00|After the First World War, 1914, I did not visit
g04-022-01|Germany for ten years, by which time in
g04-022-02|1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey.
g04-022-03|Towards the end of my five and a half years'
g04-022-04|incumbency I was asked if I would start
g04-022-05|a village choral society and conduct it.
g04-022-06|This opened up a new interest, and we plunged
g04-022-07|into it.
g04-043-00|But what a change from the dear little old church
g04-043-01|at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
g04-043-02|at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the
g04-043-03|church was, it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries
g04-043-04|had been a House of Prayer. I could not but feel the
g04-043-05|chilliness of the new church, beautiful as it was and is.
g04-043-06|When we had found a group of people who gladly
g04-043-07|co-operated, we made the little side chapel a place
g04-043-08|of daily prayer.
g04-048-00|I suggested to the congregation that it needed
g04-048-01|warming up by constant prayer and worship, and we
g04-048-02|found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and
g04-048-03|stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
g04-048-04|helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
g04-048-05|for prayer and quiet. In time we received similar
g04-048-06|gifts for the High Altar, and large East and West
g04-048-07|windows.
g04-052-00|It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
g04-052-01|such a beautiful building with suitable fittings; I made
g04-052-02|a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
g04-052-03|the architect, himself a fine artist. It is quite possible
g04-052-04|to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
g04-052-05|and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
g04-052-06|table to the environs.
g04-068-00|Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
g04-068-01|co-operation especially with the other Christian communities.
g04-068-02|At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
g04-068-03|' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees
g04-068-04|I found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help
g04-068-05|wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
g04-068-06|allowances, but soon, alas!, as casualties began and increased
g04-068-07|in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
g04-068-08|became very urgent, and I was asked to be Chairman
g04-068-09|of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.
g04-072-00|Indeed, for the next seventeen years, during my time at
g04-072-01|Purley, and from 1922 at Surbiton, I was continuously
g04-072-02|Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee. This
g04-072-03|task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
g04-072-04|the Committee. We had a splendid body of local residents,
g04-072-05|and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries. Our
g04-072-06|Committee met once a week in the evenings, and
g04-072-07|included professional men from every walk of
g04-072-08|life.
g07-000b-00|When he saw Trelawny's printed letter, Lord Sidney wrote
g07-000b-01|to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect
g07-000b-02|throughout. He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba
g07-000b-03|and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his
g07-000b-04|body to return to England than that course was
g07-000b-05|' immediately carried into effect ' - not in spite of himself
g07-000b-06|and Sir Frederick Stoven, but with their perfect con-
g07-000b-07|currence, while ' General Adam was at Corfu the whole
g07-000b-08|time and # never interfered in the slightest
g07-000b-09|degree about the matter '.
g07-079a-00|Their friendship for Augusta became rather
g07-079a-01|hollow, and the news that Byron had left
g07-079a-02|her practically all his money caused it to
g07-079a-03|crumble to oblivion. Though Lady Byron
g07-079a-04|knew perfectly well that Byron, as early
g07-079a-05|as the year of their wedding, 1815, had
g07-079a-06|made a will in Augusta's favour, she had
g07-079a-07|evidently not passed on that information;
g07-079a-08|and it came as an appalling surprise to
g07-079a-09|Captain Byron that he had been left
g07-079a-10|without the fortune that would keep up the
g07-079a-11|title.
m01-049-00|He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
m01-049-01|and came into the livingroom, where
m01-049-02|Heather and Steve stood aghast at
m01-049-03|his entrance. He came, almost falling
m01-049-04|forward in an ungainly shuffle, neck
m01-049-05|thrust out, arms dangling loosely.
m01-049-06|Then, abruptly, he drew himself up
m01-049-07|and walked on the very tips of
m01-049-08|his toes. He stretched his arms
m01-049-09|over his head and yawned agape,
m01-049-10|drawing-in great breaths that
m01-049-11|became great sighs of ecstacy.
m01-060-00|" They have come!" he said reverently, gripping his
m01-060-01|hands together between his knees and leaning
m01-060-02|forward." Isn't it a glorious thing! Long awaited
m01-060-03|transcendent event, the exalted desire of all
m01-060-04|mankind through all ages! The Kingdom of the
m01-060-05|Mind is at hand!" He turned beaming eyes
m01-060-06|upward and shook his head slowly from
m01-060-07|side to side.
m01-079-00|A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
m01-079-01|abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
m01-079-02|at an intersection for the light to change. At his
m01-079-03|apartment he garaged his car and then stood
m01-079-04|listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the
m01-079-05|earth had lost its life-tempo, as the heart
m01-079-06|loses its beat in death.
m01-084-00|Deadly stillness, deadly portent!
m01-084-01|Steve awakened early and switched on
m01-084-02|the radio, which he kept tuned to CBO.
m01-084-03|The set lighted-up but gave only a low
m01-084-04|buzzing sound. He had just finished
m01-084-05|shaving when it came on, with a flat
m01-084-06|voice repeating:" This is BBC calling
m01-084-07|... this is BBC calling..."
m01-095-00|Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
m01-095-01|Laurier, he braked to a screeching stop. A
m01-095-02|flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
m01-095-03|the War Memorial. There was a deep
m01-095-04|whirring sound, and a high-pitched hissing
m01-095-05|overtone that sang in his ears with an
m01-095-06|almost painful sharpness. He reversed and
m01-095-07|turned back on McKenzie Avenue.
m01-104-00|" The Thetans," he said," are presumably here to
m01-104-01|take charge, as it were, of the minds of the
m01-104-02|people - who are probably falling all over them-
m01-104-03|selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
m01-104-04|them out. Just what these orders will be, we don't
m01-104-05|know. Now, because of prior hypnosis we have es-
m01-104-06|caped Thetan subjugation. This time. But we no
m01-104-07|longer have any immunity.
m01-110-00|There can be little doubt that if the
m01-110-01|Thetans discover our mental independence
m01-110-02|they will promptly give us their hypnotic
m01-110-03|treatment. If we can avoid undue
m01-110-04|prominence, it may be that we can
m01-110-05|move about pretty freely without
m01-110-06|detection. If we can - well, then we
m01-110-07|may be able to promote our own
m01-110-08|interests. What those interests
m01-110-09|are, beyond personal security,
m01-110-10|I haven't a clue; but, who knows,
m01-110-11|we may form the nucleus around...
m01-121-00|There is just a hope that we may uncover
m01-121-01|some weakness, and find a way of fighting
m01-121-02|back at them." Heather agreed, and suggested
m01-121-03|that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
m01-121-04|ting how the Thetan machinations had been
m01-121-05|working out. It occurred to Steve that this may
m01-121-06|not have been entirely an objective suggestion
m01-121-07|on her part; but he thought it a good idea
m01-121-08|nevertheless.
m01-125-00|So they proceeded to see if the coast
m01-125-01|was clear. The street was quiet and
m01-125-02|deserted, and there were neither sight
m01-125-03|nor sound of flying saucers. So they
m01-125-04|ventured forth and made their way on
m01-125-05|foot to Dan's house. Dan came
m01-125-06|to the door at their ring but neglected
m01-125-07|to offer any greeting. He was deeply
m01-125-08|preoccupied, and it seemed that the
m01-125-09|ringing of a doorbell was to him
m01-125-10|a new and strange phenomenon.
m01-131-00|When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action
m01-131-01|gave the impression of having been thought out and
m01-131-02|decided upon. Inside they sat down unbidden, while
m01-131-03|Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware
m01-131-04|of their presence. They just stared at him, turning
m01-131-05|their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
m01-131-06|down, up and down.
m01-136-00|His whole attitude was a mixture of
m01-136-01|impatience pending an awaited
m01-136-02|communication and of a vague
m01-136-03|perplexity respecting his surroundings
m01-136-04|and the purpose he was to serve.
m01-136-05|Finally, being so obviously on their own,
m01-136-06|Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
m01-136-07|at home. Steve switched on Dan's
m01-136-08|powerful, world-wide radio and systematically
m01-136-09|turned the tuning knob through all the
m01-136-10|tuning points of the world's great radio
m01-149-00|They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue, where
m01-149-01|he waited. The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street.
m01-149-02|But not for long, for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon
m01-149-03|the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have
m01-149-04|been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies.
m01-149-05|First, it was Sunday morning; and, second, everyone
m01-149-06|walked, or drove, or waited as a person possessed of
m01-149-07|a single all-exclusive purpose.
m02-048-00|Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
m02-048-01|real days and would return to New York in late
m02-048-02|January or early February. Angelina might be a
m02-048-03|little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
m02-048-04|as arranged, but he consoled himself by
m02-048-05|thinking that he and Angelina would have
m02-048-06|plenty of time together in the future. And
m02-048-07|Heaven alone knew when, if ever, he would be
m02-048-08|back on Moon again, and able to do
m02-048-09|research at first hand into matters on which
m02-048-10|the future of everyone, including Angelina, depended...
m02-055-00|They had been married for six years, but the
m02-055-01|salary raise, on the expectation of which they
m02-055-02|had done so, had not materialised." Do you
m02-055-03|know, I had to send back our bedroom
m02-055-04|furniture in the second year," she moaned. She
m02-055-05|had contacts in political circles, a school-
m02-055-06|friend of hers having married Lester Peron,
m02-055-07|a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the
m02-055-08|( literally) all-powerful Rocket Release
m02-055-09|Board.
m02-055-10|Hostettler
m02-059-00|Sometimes she took Harry around with her, but
m02-059-01|never her husband, a fact he accepted as inevitable." I guess
m02-059-02|Sally made a mistake about me," he said one
m02-059-03|evening, when he had been left to cook his own meal.
m02-059-04|All Sally's relations were 4makrodeb now, but Tom
m02-059-05|was a Static Mib, the middle-income-bracket equivalent
m02-059-06|to 4sub-lil on the lower.
m02-066-00|All Aristotle was excited at the time, not by the prospect of the
m02-066-01|U.S. President's visit, but by a great storm in the photo-
m02-066-02|sphere of the sun. A matter which on Earth would hardly
m02-066-03|penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
m02-066-04|interest to the Mos, doubtless because their habitat is
m02-066-05|not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere.
m02-069-00|One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might
m02-069-01|with time instil the reverence which, on Earth, nature inspires,
m02-069-02|especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's
m02-069-03|Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the
m02-069-04|solar system. True enough, such ultimate weapons had not been
m02-069-05|used in the last few wars, but it seemed very probable
m02-069-06|that they would be in the next one, Moon and her
m02-069-07|allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the
m02-069-08|weapons pronounced conventional.
m02-072-00|Lester was not home yet from his formidable
m02-072-01|duties and his wife, in the manner of middle-brow
m02-072-02|wives, romanced about him in his absence." Lester was a
m02-072-03|country lawyer, and we were very small 4microdebs, weren't we,
m02-072-04|Sally" - here she had dropped her voice in homage to the
m02-072-05|economic system: that was reverenced -" when he thought
m02-072-06|we might get GO a bit better if he entered politics.
m02-080-00|Sentence Database
m02-080-01|That 's how he got the votes, that 's how
m02-080-02|we came through to 4makrodeb status and
m02-080-03|got all these lovely things" - she waved a
m02-080-04|plump hand towards her grand pianos, etc:
m02-080-05|at the same time a door banged -" but don't
m02-080-06|say a word about it, Lester wants his
m02-080-07|mouth-organ to be forgotten now. The time
m02-080-08|has come for him to be taken seriously
m02-080-09|as a statesman."
m02-087-00|But privately he turned out to be as friendly as
m02-087-01|Mr. Wise the tube manufacturer, to have the same adolescent
m02-087-02|openness and freshness, though perhaps not the same
m02-087-03|maturity. One remembered that he was a lawyer
m02-087-04|by training, and suspected that the points he made
m02-087-05|so sharply in international politics were as abstract
m02-087-06|to him as those a lawyer makes in a court
m02-087-07|of law.
m02-095-00|The political life of Aristotle looked more and more
m02-095-01|like a masquerade of business interests in dis-
m02-095-02|guise which, far from attracting the allegiance
m02-095-03|of free men everywhere, could only repel them.
m02-095-04|Then what of the cultural life? Did this per-
m02-095-05|haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse
m02-095-06|which might in time become social fact
m02-095-07|and counteract the obsession with economics
m02-095-08|which had grown up during the Moon's
m02-095-09|first two centuries?
m02-109-00|Stepping out in their white shorts, they looked glad enough
m02-109-01|to be diverted, however, with the single exception of one
m02-109-02|worried little man-student who kept getting out of
m02-109-03|step. He looked as if nothing Moke and his
m02-109-04|minions could do to him would ever make him
m02-109-05|GO; but the reason probably lay in elementary
m02-109-06|neurosis and not in some eruption from those
m02-109-07|deeper layers in the human psyche which are
m02-109-08|trans-economic.
m02-112-00|So once again the metaphysics were depressing,
m02-112-01|and in absolute contrast to the physical display.
m02-112-02|Mos have an un-American love of parades, and
m02-112-03|these young ones, on parade for jobs which they
m02-112-04|had to get to pay off their college bills, were naturally
m02-112-05|putting their best foot forward.
m03-006-00|' Something 's up, ' said Lord Undertone,
m03-006-01|carefully casual. ' The servants are all on
m03-006-02|edge... did you notice? And the mules
m03-006-03|didn't seem to want to get off the raft. '
m03-006-04|He peered as it were into the dark secrets
m03-006-05|of the jungle. ' Think there 's Indians
m03-006-06|about? ' It was most certainly an eerie
m03-006-07|night, exceptionally brilliant and strange,
m03-006-08|for in the proximity of the mountains,
m03-006-09|whose presence I could almost smell,
m03-013-00|' Impressive, ' Lord Undertone said, gazing reverently
m03-013-01|on the cosmic handiwork. ' All those stars. But I 'm
m03-013-02|a bit earthbound tonight, Trout. I 've got a queer
m03-013-03|feeling, like I always get when something
m03-013-04|sensational 's going to happen. There 's things lurking
m03-013-05|if you ask me. Might be jaguar, might be...
m03-013-06|head-shrinkers.
m03-020-00|Hope I die kind of composed, Trout. I mean you can't
m03-020-01|imagine the Christian martyrs twisting and shrieking,
m03-020-02|no matter how bad it felt, the fire you know, or a
m03-020-03|lion munching, or arrows where it hurts most. Or
m03-020-04|can you. Look over there. ' He pointed to the
m03-020-05|shadows beyond the river. ' Something moved. '
m03-033-00|' Bottle-Foot, my lord. ' ' Bottle-Foot? ' His lordship
m03-033-01|may have thought I had become unbalanced
m03-033-02|through fear. ' A character Mr Gilberto mentioned
m03-033-03|to other day, my lord. A being of whom
m03-033-04|the forest Indians are said to be mortally
m03-033-05|afraid, with a hoof shaped like the heel
m03-033-06|of a bottle. If your lordship will excuse me
m03-033-07|a moment... '
m03-110-00|Sally and of course Mrs Septimus, for surely
m03-110-01|Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
m03-110-02|myself? But was it so? I allowed myself
m03-110-03|to entertain for an instant the idea, the
m03-110-04|strange, the unwelcome, the almost
m03-110-05|inconceivable idea, that Ariadne's arrival
m03-110-06|would be inopportune; and with the idea came
m03-110-07|a somewhat vulgar impulse, which I refused,
m03-110-08|to watch Mr Septimus more closely, Mrs
m03-110-09|Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would...
m03-114-00|But all three were to the casual
m03-114-01|observation I permitted myself unruffled;
m03-114-02|Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
m03-114-03|thoughtful, but that was his habit. Indeed
m03-114-04|we were all invaded by a most tranquil
m03-114-05|mood. Even the Indian servants relaxed, knowing,
m03-114-06|so Mr Gilberto told us, that the wild and
m03-114-07|savage tribes never approached this region: at
m03-114-08|any rate they remained with us, perhaps
m03-114-09|for such protection as our presence, or Mrs
m03-118-00|But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
m03-118-01|far from our minds that at any moment we were
m03-118-02|to receive a summons. I could see that Mr Septimus
m03-118-03|was impatient for it. This afternoon, then, we climbed
m03-118-04|a promontory, a mass of clean rock crowned with
m03-118-05|trees and bushes, that stood well out over the lake.
m04-030-00|" Good-bye, Dai," said Morfydd, smiling from the bottom step.
m04-030-01|" Good-bye, Morfydd." He sought to enfold her in his arms. But he was too late.
m04-030-02|She was already up the bus steps, and the bus was away. And Morfydd Owen
m04-030-03|waving, unkissed, from the window. And Dai, on the pavement, knowing in his
m04-030-04|heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas.
m04-038-00|So the bus set out for Llangrwl. But it never reached there! Somewhere,
m04-038-01|on those fifteen miles of mountain roads, it disappeared from the earthly
m04-038-02|scene. The first intimation that all was not well came when a
m04-038-03|Mr. Isaiah Roberts, landlord of The Traveller's Joy, rang up the
m04-038-04|Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
m04-038-05|damn bus.
m04-043-00|" Left here all right," said Ifor." Two-thirty-five, on the dot." " It 's
m04-043-01|supposed to leave at two-twenty." " Who says so?" " Your timetable."
m04-043-02|" Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables," Ifor said,
m04-043-03|reasonably." Start running punctual and where are you? People get
m04-043-04|left behind, isn't it? Very exasperating for one and all."
m04-061-00|" And what are you going to do about it?" Tendentious, Mr. Roberts sounded.
m04-061-01|" What do you want me to do? Send out a sheriff's posse, is it?" No sense
m04-061-02|of humour, that Isaiah. He banged down the receiver. Very uncivil. Dropped
m04-061-03|the mask, now, Ifor did." Dai Pugh," he bellowed." Leap on your bicycle
m04-061-04|and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy.
m04-072-00|The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
m04-072-01|complete her mission." Paled, did Dai. For the
m04-072-02|two-twenty carried, for him, a cargo more
m04-072-03|precious than jewels. Though Mofydd Owen
m04-072-04|was, as he feared, departed out of his life,
m04-072-05|he still loved her dearly. Already, even
m04-072-06|as with trembling fingers he fastened his
m04-072-07|trouser clips, he was seeing her lying in
m04-072-08|some dreadful ravine, or beset by
m04-072-09|robbers, or being whisked off to Emergency
m04-072-10|Ward 10.
m04-078-00|But even his imagination, luckily for him,
m04-078-01|did not visualise the awful truth - that
m04-078-02|Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
m04-078-03|the title of" First Woman to Enter Space."
m04-078-04|" Where are we going, Mam?" inquired little
m04-078-05|Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
m04-078-06|the fact that the green earth was falling
m04-078-07|away at a rate of knots.
m04-081-00|Where indeed? Megan Thomas spoke sharply
m04-081-01|to the conductor, demanding an explanation.
m04-081-02|But nonplussed, the conductor was. A
m04-081-03|good man, mind; knew his job. But out of
m04-081-04|depth in this particular instance. Fingered
m04-081-05|his ticket-punch nervously. Peered out of
m04-081-06|the window. Went and consulted the driver.
m04-081-07|" Where are we going?" he echoed Cadwallader.
m04-081-08|" Damned if I know, boy," said the driver.
m04-081-09|" But something very untoward has
m04-081-10|happened, if you ask me."
m04-093-00|Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser, was the
m04-093-01|Rev. Edwards. Now he put down his paper,
m04-093-02|folded it, and glanced idly out of the
m04-093-03|window. Looked again, eyes starting from
m04-093-04|his head." God bless my immortal soul,"
m04-093-05|he cried." Never mind your immortal
m04-093-06|soul," said Megan Thomas tartly.
m04-093-07|" Here we are traversing the heavens at the
m04-093-08|very moment when we should be
m04-093-09|running into Llangrwl bus station.
m04-100-00|And no one doing the first thing about
m04-100-01|it." Stung, the conductor was." What you
m04-100-02|expect me to do?" he inquired, bitter.
m04-100-03|" Radio Flying Control at London Airport,
m04-100-04|is it?" " Mutual recriminations will get
m04-100-05|us nowhere," boomed the Rev. Edwards.
m04-100-06|" It 's all very well," commented
m04-100-07|Mr. Hayball from the back seat.
m04-107-00|" But Eth and me wanted to be
m04-107-01|at the Youth Hostel before dark."
m04-107-02|Morfydd Owen was silent. But she
m04-107-03|looked down at the fast-disappearing
m04-107-04|earth, and it seemed to her that she
m04-107-05|would never see her Dai again. And
m04-107-06|though half an hour ago she had
m04-107-07|regarded this possibility with
m04-107-08|fortitude, it now filled her with
m04-107-09|dismay. Quietly she began to
m04-107-10|weep...
m04-113-00|Dai, meanwhile, was pedalling
m04-113-01|furiously on the road. Not a sign of
m04-113-02|the bus. He passed The Traveller's
m04-113-03|Joy. At last he caught up Mr. Roberts,
m04-113-04|walking very dogged towards Llangrwl.
m04-113-05|" Afternoon, Mr. Roberts," he called, polite,
m04-113-06|as he shot past. His spirits were rising.
m04-113-07|He had seen no sign of an accident.
m04-113-08|Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken.
m04-113-09|He would find the bus safe and sound in
m04-113-10|Llangrwl, and his dear Morfydd quietly
m04-123-00|But disappointment awaited him. A
m04-123-01|restive queue of people in the bus station,
m04-123-02|waiting to be transported to Dinas. And
m04-123-03|when he went to Morfydd's house, all
m04-123-04|he found was Morfydd's mam, working
m04-123-05|herself up proper... Getting dark, now.
m04-123-06|The conductor switched on the lights.
m04-123-07|The beleaguered passengers peered out of
m04-123-08|the windows. Little to be seen, only a
m04-123-09|few lone stars, and the distant earth
m04-123-10|brooding in her shroud of mist.
m04-131-00|Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped, nursing
m04-131-01|the sleeping Cadwallader. Driver and
m04-131-02|conductor peered ahead into nothingness.
m04-131-03|On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced
m04-131-04|his Eth. Morfydd thought of Dai. The
m04-131-05|Rev. Edwards, standing at the front,
m04-131-06|looked at his forlorn flock." What
m04-131-07|about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda?"
m04-131-08|he suggested hopefully.
m04-138-00|They looked at him, sullen. His heart
m04-138-01|sank. If the Welsh found the situation
m04-138-02|too desperate for singing, then the
m04-138-03|situation, he realised, must be desperate
m04-138-04|indeed. But suddenly they were roused
m04-138-05|from their lethargy. Something was
m04-138-06|approaching, faster, faster, a tearing
m04-138-07|hurrying blur that was past and gone
m04-138-08|in a moment, followed by a great
m04-138-09|rush of sound. They waved frantically.
m04-231-00|" Do as I say, driver." Very stern, the reverend
m04-231-01|gentleman was. So the driver peep-peeped as
m04-231-02|through empty space." Thank you," the Rev.
m04-231-03|Edwards said courteously." Secondly, we must
m04-231-04|pool and ration our supplies of food, if any."
m04-231-05|He looked at Price the Provisions, who was nursing
m04-231-06|a great basket.
m04-238-00|" Now, who has any food?" he asked hopefully.
m04-238-01|Stared back did Price the Provisions, unwinking.
m04-238-02|" Mr. Price, I think you may be able to help us here,"
m04-238-03|said the Rev. Edwards. Price shook his head.
m04-238-04|" Intended for Plas Newydd, this lot is. Paid for,
m04-238-05|too." He folded his arms protectively over the basket.
m04-246-00|Mutinous dog, thought the Rev. Edwards, who hadn't
m04-246-01|enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure
m04-246-02|Island." What have you got in that basket, Price?"
m04-246-03|he roared. Quelled, Mr. Price pulled out a grocery
m04-246-04|list, pushed his glasses up on his nose, and
m04-246-05|began to read." Six loaves, four pounds butter,
m04-246-06|two pounds marge, one tin pineapple, one York ham."
m06-031-00|' But we - ' ' Stop your stupid talk, woman! ' ' We are - '
m06-031-01|' Be silent, woman, and listen, ' Band Appa Bondi said.
m06-031-02|' We know much, ' repeated the Chief Captive. ' Some
m06-031-03|things we will tell you. All who make the journey from
m06-031-04|the Heavy World become changed. Some die. Most live
m06-031-05|and grow wings. Between the worlds are many strong
m06-031-06|rays, not seen or felt, which change our bodies.
m06-042-00|When you come here, when you come to the True
m06-042-01|World, you become a true human. The grub of the
m06-042-02|tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes. So humans
m06-042-03|change. ' ' I cannot know what he says, ' Haris said
m06-042-04|stubbornly, throwing himself down. But Lily-yo and
m06-042-05|Flor were listening.
m06-048-00|' To this True World, as you call it, we come to die, '
m06-048-01|Lily-yo said, doubtingly. The Captive with the
m06-048-02|fleshless jaw said, ' The grub of the tigerfly thinks
m06-048-03|it dies when it changes into a tigerfly. ' ' You are still
m06-048-04|young, ' said the Chief Captive. ' You begin newly here.
m06-048-05|Where are your souls? ' Lily-yo and Flor looked at
m06-048-06|each other. In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
m06-048-07|heedlessly thrown down their souls.
m06-056-00|Haris had trampled on his. It was unthinkable!
m06-056-01|' You see. You needed them no more. You are still
m06-056-02|young. You may be able to have babies. Some of those
m06-056-03|babies may be born with wings. ' The Captive with
m06-056-04|the boneless arms added, ' Some may be born wrong,
m06-056-05|as we are. Some may be born right. '
m06-067-00|' You are too foul to live! ' Haris growled. ' Why are
m06-067-01|you not killed? ' ' Because we know all things, ' the
m06-067-02|Chief Captive said. Suddenly his second head roused
m06-067-03|itself and declared, ' To be a good shape is not all
m06-067-04|in life. To know is also good. Because we cannot move
m06-067-05|well we can - think. This tribe of the True World
m06-067-06|is good and knows these things.
m06-076-00|So it lets us rule it. ' Flor and Lily-yo
m06-076-01|muttered together. ' Do you say that you poor
m06-076-02|Captives rule the True World? ' Lily-yo asked
m06-076-03|at last. ' We do. ' ' Then why are you captives? '
m06-076-04|The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected,
m06-076-05|making his perpetual little gesture of protest,
m06-076-06|spoke for the first time.
m06-083-00|' To rule is to serve, woman. Those who bear power
m06-083-01|are slaves to it. Only an outcast is free. Because
m06-083-02|we are Captives, we have the time to talk and
m06-083-03|think and plan and know. Those who know
m06-083-04|command the knives of others. ' ' No hurt will
m06-083-05|come to you, Lily-yo, ' Band Appa Bondi added.
m06-083-06|' You will live among us and enjoy your life free
m06-083-07|from harm. '
m06-091-00|' No! ' the Chief Captive said with both mouths.
m06-091-01|' Before she can enjoy, Lily-yo and her companion
m06-091-02|Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
m06-091-03|must help our great plan. ' ' The invasion? ' Bondi
m06-091-04|asked. ' What else? Flor and Lily-yo, you arrive
m06-091-05|here at a good time. Memories of the Heavy World
m06-091-06|and its savage life are still fresh in you.
m06-098-00|We need such memories. So we ask you to go
m06-098-01|back there on a great plan we have. ' ' Go back? '
m06-098-02|gasped Flor. ' Yes. We plan to attack the Heavy
m06-098-03|World. You must help to lead our force. ' The long
m06-098-04|afternoon of eternity wore on, that long golden road
m06-098-05|of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
m06-098-06|everlasting night.
m06-106-00|Motion there was, but motion without event - except
m06-106-01|for those negligible events that seemed so large to
m06-106-02|the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor
m06-106-03|and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was
m06-106-04|that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
m06-106-05|with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
m06-106-06|new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
m06-106-07|light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
m06-106-08|flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
m06-106-09|had no place here.
n01-000-00|Alastair was a bachelor. All his life he had
n01-000-01|been inclined to regard women as something
n01-000-02|which must necessarily be subordinated to his
n01-000-03|career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
n01-000-04|his own life, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl
n01-000-05|whom he had never met and on whom after no more
n01-000-06|than a couple of telephone calls he was
n01-000-07|prepared to place complete reliance.
n01-004-00|It was a novel experience. Alastair was
n01-004-01|quite unable to explain why he should feel
n01-004-02|so much confidence in her. Once again
n01-004-03|she checked back her instructions. It was
n01-004-04|obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
n01-004-05|faith which he was placing in her and
n01-004-06|was prepared to accept the responsibility.
n01-009-00|" Good luck, Air Marshal," she said gently." I 'll
n01-009-01|be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
n01-009-02|evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
n01-009-03|both at midnight." They might have been
n01-009-04|arranging a supper party. Then she rang off.
n01-009-05|Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
n01-009-06|uneventful life had he come across a girl who
n01-009-07|sounded so charming and appeared to be so
n01-009-08|efficient.
n01-020-00|For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
n01-020-01|to switch on the lights; there was no colour -
n01-020-02|physical features were distinguishable solely by
n01-020-03|gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-
n01-020-04|capped summit of Mont Blanc, seven miles
n01-020-05|below, was not recognisable among the host
n01-020-06|of lower peaks. The screen of the air-to-air
n01-020-07|radar glowed. Occasionally minute spots
n01-020-08|flickered across its surface, but there was
n01-020-09|no permanent image.
n01-031-00|In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
n01-031-01|make a direct comparison between the radar
n01-031-02|image and the ground itself. Ahead lay the
n01-031-03|Plain of Lombardy; to the right, Turin; to the
n01-031-04|left, Milan. The directional angle of the
n01-031-05|scanner could be adjusted to cover any
n01-031-06|particular area within its range. Geoffrey
n01-031-07|turned the scale slowly to cover the
n01-031-08|ground immediately ahead.
n01-036-00|He was able to pick out towns, unrecognisable to the
n01-036-01|naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even
n01-036-02|on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced
n01-036-03|at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that
n01-036-04|the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
n01-036-05|was resting could really mean hundreds of knots.
n01-045-00|Now, as Alastair reduced the thrust, the
n01-045-01|pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
n01-045-02|dipped slightly. The needle of the speed
n01-045-03|recorder swung gently through 8.0, 7.0, 6.0
n01-045-04|before coming to rest at 5.0." We 're a bit
n01-045-05|ahead of time," said Alastair." We 'll run
n01-045-06|in on minimum engine power." Geoffrey
n01-045-07|smiled. Alastair talked of running in when
n01-045-08|they were still more than four hundred
n01-045-09|miles from their destination.
n01-052-00|They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
n01-052-01|on the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port.
n01-052-02|He was able to trace the course of the river; he
n01-052-03|thought he could recognise the route of N12,
n01-052-04|along which he had motored so desperately little
n01-052-05|more than twenty-four hours earlier. Since then
n01-052-06|he had flown to England, attended the vital
n01-052-07|conference in Bruce Denton's office, been whisked
n01-052-08|by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
n01-052-09|Parade to Boscombe Down, slept for six blessed
n01-052-10|refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
n01-052-11|of the journey back to the place where every
n01-052-12|indication pointed to Eve being held.
n01-057-00|Geoffrey set himself to consider the
n01-057-01|movements of the Bentley. It had passed
n01-057-02|him at the temporary bridge over the
n01-057-03|Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
n01-057-04|previous night. He worked out the distance
n01-057-05|on the presumption that its route had been
n01-057-06|through Florence and Rome and then
n01-057-07|across Italy via Foggia to Barletta.
n01-057-08|It came to just over six hundred
n01-057-09|miles.
n02-004-00|To Beryl, at least, this was anti-climax with a
n02-004-01|vengeance. She had expected to be met with violent
n02-004-02|reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling.
n02-004-03|But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
n02-004-04|was less pleasant than appeared on the surface.
n02-004-05|He told her nonchalantly, as he led the way to his
n02-004-06|own veranda, that he had taken the liberty of
n02-004-07|asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
n02-004-08|to come over and make the presentation in her stead.
n02-009-00|" I caught him just as he was going to the
n02-009-01|airport to meet Blanche," he said." As a matter
n02-009-02|of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise
n02-009-03|for me and fetch her. He brought her to the party
n02-009-04|too. They 're both here." " I didn't know she was
n02-009-05|coming back from Barbados so soon." Beryl
n02-009-06|said the first thing that came into her head.
n02-028-00|Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise, and to
n02-028-01|express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
n02-028-02|of his guests. But Piers remained aloof, and when Beryl
n02-028-03|suggested having a second party, the following week, he
n02-028-04|poured cold water on the project. Everyone, he declared,
n02-028-05|had had a thoroughly good time, and it would take them
n02-028-06|nearly to next week to settle down again. Meanwhile
n02-028-07|Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
n02-028-08|earned gratuity to his native village at the
n02-028-09|north of the island.
n02-033-00|It was all over and done with.
n02-033-01|For the time being Beryl was content to let
n02-033-02|it go at that, but she resolved to have
n02-033-03|it out with Piers when a reasonable
n02-033-04|opportunity presented itself. He must
n02-033-05|learn that he could not treat her
n02-033-06|with injustice and contempt, ignoring
n02-033-07|her explanations as though he were
n02-033-08|a schoolmaster and she a small,
n02-033-09|ignorant child.
n02-037-00|He gave her no chance of any private
n02-037-01|conversation that evening, for when
n02-037-02|Blanche and Jack left, he went with
n02-037-03|them. But next morning she insisted
n02-037-04|on his taking her out in the jeep -
n02-037-05|to find, if possible, Hubert and his
n02-037-06|relations, and tell them of
n02-037-07|her great disappointment at being
n02-037-08|held up in Balicou.
n02-040-00|With an air of resignation he sent Judy, his
n02-040-01|Boxer, to the back, and made room for her
n02-040-02|beside him." Is that all you want to do?"
n02-040-03|he asked, letting in the clutch." No; I want
n02-040-04|to make you understand just what happened
n02-040-05|about this Balicou trip," she returned
n02-040-06|coldly." I 'm a little tired of being treated
n02-040-07|like an ineffective imbecile."
n02-045-00|" And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called
n02-045-01|to account for my manners," he retorted.
n02-045-02|" What have I done wrong now? I cover up for
n02-045-03|you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
n02-045-04|to make the presentation, I run the damned
n02-045-05|party to the best of my ability - saying the
n02-045-06|sugary things you ought to have been there
n02-045-07|to say - and all you can do is to find
n02-045-08|fault."
n02-049-00|" It 's your superior attitude that riles me." Beryl was
n02-049-01|scarlet with annoyance." How I happened to be marooned
n02-049-02|at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree. You
n02-049-03|look as though it was only what you expected of me,
n02-049-04|as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
n02-049-05|and his pals down."
n02-054-00|" As your employee it 's not my business
n02-054-01|to understand all the whys and
n02-054-02|wherefores of your actions," he said
n02-054-03|stiffly." Still less to criticise you."
n02-054-04|" Oh, drop that nonsense, Piers!
n02-054-05|Be yourself," she exclaimed, with
n02-054-06|mounting exasperation." Very well!" He
n02-054-07|brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
n02-054-08|path fringed and shaded by citrus trees.
n02-054-09|" If you want my true opinion I 'll give it.
n02-062-00|You made some sort of a protest to Graybury.
n02-062-01|I 'll give you credit for that. But you didn't press
n02-062-02|the matter because, very naturally, you were
n02-062-03|thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
n02-062-04|idyllic surroundings." " How dare you say
n02-062-05|such a thing?" she blazed." For goodness'
n02-062-06|sake show a glimmer of reason," was his
n02-062-07|equally indignant rejoinder.
n02-104-00|" I know. Absurd as it may seem, I didn't want
n02-104-01|you to think badly of me." She turned away
n02-104-02|from him to fondle Judy, who, sensing something
n02-104-03|amiss, was nudging her in the endeavour to
n02-104-04|gain her attention." The truth is that
n02-104-05|if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
n02-104-06|time originally arranged, Sir John would
n02-104-07|have had it in for Guy.
n02-109-00|You see, it was, apparently, through a mistake
n02-109-01|on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
n02-109-02|flamingoes our first morning on the island."
n02-109-03|" What harm could possibly have come to Forrest
n02-109-04|through Sir John's nonsense?" Piers could
n02-109-05|hardly have spoken with more contempt.
n02-109-06|A bully like that respects anyone who
n02-109-07|dares to stand up to him."
n02-114-00|Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
n02-114-01|precisely the remark she had made to Guy.
n02-114-02|She said icily," As you pride yourself on
n02-114-03|your knowledge of all the affairs of the
n02-114-04|island I needn't tell you that Sir John
n02-114-05|Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
n02-114-06|important customers." " So what? You 're not
n02-114-07|trying to say that Hewson would victimise
n02-114-08|Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
n02-114-09|courage!
n02-120-00|He 's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
n02-120-01|himself and his business to an unmention-
n02-120-02|able destination." " There 's a difference
n02-120-03|between what a senior and a junior
n02-120-04|partner can do," was her quick reply.
n02-120-05|" What they can bring off! I 'll admit that.
n02-120-06|But Forrest might at least have tried. He 's
n02-120-07|pretty spineless!"
n02-127-00|" You think you could have carried more weight
n02-127-01|with Sir John?" she enquired cuttingly.
n02-127-02|" For all your good opinion of yourself,
n02-127-03|I doubt it. He 's about as easy to push around
n02-127-04|as - as a grounded whale!" He had to smile
n02-127-05|at that, but went on airily," I 'd have made
n02-127-06|an attempt to show my lady-love that I
n02-127-07|put her interests before my own.
n02-151-00|Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
n02-151-01|to have been guests at yesterday's
n02-151-02|celebrations, and their friendly welcome
n02-151-03|and warm sympathy, as she explained
n02-151-04|how she had come to miss the party,
n02-151-05|made her send a complacent glance
n02-151-06|in Piers' direction. What a fuss-box the
n02-151-07|man was, she thought impatiently,
n02-151-08|trying to worry her into the belief
n02-151-09|that her failure to appear at a function
n02-151-10|on the estate was a major error:
n02-154-00|And then she received a jolt. Old Hubert, standing
n02-154-01|beside her, his battered hat in his hand, his
n02-154-02|toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin, told her
n02-154-03|in halting 6patois that" 3Mistah Piers" had
n02-154-04|explained right at the start that" 3Mis' Beryl"
n02-154-05|would be 3" plenty, plenty sad" not to be back
n02-154-06|at the Villa in time.
n02-157-00|That it wouldn't be her fault at all. That
n02-157-01|she was a lady who, like her Uncle Charles,
n02-157-02|took the highest pride in keeping her word." I
n02-157-03|could see 3anudder 3t'ing," he went on in a
n02-157-04|lower voice, his sunken black eyes twinkling.
n02-157-05|3" He powerful anxious, poor Mistah Piers.
n02-157-06|We all know how Balicou Island dangerous
n02-157-07|to all kin' o' boats, wid d'ose big, big
n02-157-08|rocks in an' out o' de water.
n03-038-00|He had almost entirely settled back into his old
n03-038-01|ways, even to reading law about two hours each
n03-038-02|day. Though he did not refuse wine, which the
n03-038-03|judge always had on the table at dinner, he
n03-038-04|did not act as though he found it necessary
n03-038-05|except in moderate compliance with his father's
n03-038-06|habit.
n03-064-00|Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
n03-064-01|white spray could be seen flying across the distance
n03-064-02|of a mile and a half, came the yawl under her full
n03-064-03|triangular sail, and to the judge's frightened eyes, so
n03-064-04|close to the rocks that it would be dashed
n03-064-05|against them with the lift of the next wave.
n03-066-00|" That boy! That damned fool boy! What does he mean
n03-066-01|by trying to come home now, even if he did promise?
n03-066-02|What does time mean when weighed against the life of
n03-066-03|two human beings?" Not until he was certain that the
n03-066-04|yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of
n03-066-05|being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
n03-066-06|empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them
n03-066-07|with part of that howling northwest gale.
n03-097-00|" My God!" the judge cried out." The boy
n03-097-01|is going to try to make a landing on the
n03-097-02|weather side of that pier! He 'll wreck!"
n03-097-03|Willie Kim was speechless, only his slant
n03-097-04|black eyes showing any emotion. With a
n03-097-05|quick shift of tiller, and at the same time
n03-097-06|jibbing the boom to which he had the
n03-097-07|stay rope fastened, Bill made the
n03-097-08|yawl recover.
n03-103-00|It seemed to the frightened judge
n03-103-01|as though his son would actually
n03-103-02|shoot the craft in under the outer
n03-103-03|end of the wharf. But by pressing
n03-103-04|the tiller hard over and at the
n03-103-05|same time dropping the small sheet
n03-103-06|of wet canvas, Bill cleared the
n03-103-07|corner of the pier by inches, and
n03-103-08|with the tiller still hard over, brought
n03-103-09|the yawl up against the waves
n03-106-00|" Willie," the judge said huskily,
n03-106-01|" that was as pretty a piece of seamans-
n03-106-02|hip as I ever saw. That boy of
n03-106-03|mine seems to know how to do
n03-106-04|everything, when he wants to."
n03-106-05|" 3Naw," disputed Willie. 3" Just
n03-106-06|play in damn fine luck this time.
n03-106-07|He plenty smart though." As they
n03-106-08|reached the pier, the judge on legs
n03-106-09|that were a little unsteady, they
n03-106-10|found Bueno Buck, now on the
n03-106-11|pier, leading the yawl toward
n03-113-00|" Hello, Dad!" Bill called." I hope you
n03-113-01|weren't worried. We 're going to
n03-113-02|drag the boat ashore and turn
n03-113-03|her over. She has a foot of
n03-113-04|water in her. I wouldn't be
n03-113-05|surprised if we broke all
n03-113-06|speed records on the way in.
n03-113-07|Yes sir, I am slightly wet, and
n03-113-08|Buck would be wetter if he
n03-113-09|had more clothes on."
n03-120-00|With four doing the job and the waves
n03-120-01|pushing at the stern, the yawl was soon
n03-120-02|dragged out but before it was turned
n03-120-03|over Bueno Buck reached into the foot
n03-120-04|of water, tossed out a string of silvery
n03-120-05|lake trout and said - 3" Bill, he 's better
n03-120-06|man at catch 'em than Injun, Judge.
n03-120-07|You look. Little one more as fifteen
n03-120-08|inches. Maybe big one four feet,
n03-120-09|huh?"
n03-126-00|" By George, that is a beautiful string of fish!"
n03-126-01|exclaimed the judge." Toss them on the grass
n03-126-02|and then we 'll all get hold and heave." A
n03-126-03|few moments later the yawl was upside
n03-126-04|down, exposing its shallow keel.
n04-000-00|Bertram's face was grim." You think it was the Snort,
n04-000-01|don't you?" John gave a short laugh." I did," he
n04-000-02|said;" but I 'd better stop thinking that now.
n04-000-03|Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one."
n04-000-04|" So there you are, my dear." Peggy 's eyes filled
n04-000-05|with tears." It 's so unfair," she said.
n04-009-00|" That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six
n04-009-01|months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the
n04-009-02|dockyard and now that she 's ready for sea he goes
n04-009-03|sick. Just because he 's an Honourable he can do
n04-009-04|what he likes. Anyway, why pick on you to succeed
n04-009-05|him?" John didn't answer. There was no point
n04-009-06|in sharing his discomfort with Peggy.
n04-048-00|So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head, that
n04-048-01|famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in historic
n04-048-02|interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German
n04-048-03|bombs during the last war. Having deposited his
n04-048-04|baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
n04-048-05|went in search of a drink. The lower bar was
n04-048-06|empty, save for the lady known by all habitue
n04-048-07|*?2s as ' Seaweed ', and a youngish, sharp-eyed
n04-048-08|man who was staring moodily into a gin
n04-048-09|and tonic.
n04-052-00|Seaweed's memory was prodigious; her manner
n04-052-01|must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
n04-052-02|of the hotel. She greeted John, however, with less
n04-052-03|than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
n04-052-04|glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
n04-052-05|of the bar was not 6persona grata. If her
n04-052-06|memory was good, so was this stranger's.
n04-052-07|" You 're Commander Winter," he said." Have a
n04-052-08|gin?" He turned to Seaweed -
n04-060-00|" Make it a large one, darling. I know the naval
n04-060-01|habits. ' Drink gin and call each other wallahs,
n04-060-02|what! ' - as the Guards officer said on his return
n04-060-03|from a visit to the Royal Navy. Submarines, what.
n04-060-04|Youngest D.S.C. in the war, what? Crawled
n04-060-05|inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
n04-060-06|bomb. Should have been a V.C.
n04-068-00|What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is
n04-068-01|obviously thirsty." John fought back his
n04-068-02|inherited desire to snub the man. If he did he
n04-068-03|would have to leave the bar and either sit in
n04-068-04|the lounge or return to his bedroom.
n04-068-05|Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
n04-068-06|came to the rescue." You haven't introduced
n04-068-07|yourself," she said with mock severity.
n04-075-00|" It 's a rule on these premises. No treating with
n04-075-01|strangers - that 's right, John, isn't it?" " My
n04-075-02|fault entirely," said the stranger." It 's my conceited
n04-075-03|nature - I assumed that you both knew who I
n04-075-04|was. I 'm Ian Bawley. Does that mean anything
n04-075-05|to you?" It did. Ian Bawley's name was
n04-075-06|printed at the head of most naval articles
n04-075-07|in the Daily Courier.
n04-084-00|" Oh, the Press," said Seaweed." Down here on business, Mr.
n04-084-01|Bawley?" " A pressman is always on the job."
n04-084-02|He held out his hand and John could not do
n04-084-03|otherwise than take it." Pleased to meet you,
n04-084-04|Commander," he said." Now what about that
n04-084-05|drink?" John nodded - he could afford to buy
n04-084-06|one in return and he was lonely.
n04-092-00|" For the sake of accuracy," he said," and I
n04-092-01|know how you newspaper people value that commodity! -
n04-092-02|please don't address me as Commander. I 'm
n04-092-03|a Lieutenant-Commander. Perhaps we could
n04-092-04|drop the rank - such a mouthful!" " You 're
n04-092-05|absolutely right," said Bawley, as he pushed over
n04-092-06|his glass." Fill it up, darling. Accuracy above
n04-092-07|all else. We pride ourselves about accuracy on
n04-092-08|the Courier.
n04-100-00|Ever known us bowl a wide about your Service?
n04-100-01|Check and counter-check - nothing but the truth.
n04-100-02|Somewhat embarrassing, what?" " How can the
n04-100-03|truth be embarrassing?" John sipped his double
n04-100-04|gin with relish. It was his favourite brand,
n04-100-05|he was on the verge of a new chapter in
n04-100-06|his career, and his companion's attitude was
n04-100-07|challenging.
n04-107-00|Life at home and in Bath had been a
n04-107-01|trifle too comfortable and humdrum.
n04-107-02|He 'd never before met a pressman and
n04-107-03|found him curiously stimulating." You 're a
n04-107-04|bit of a humorist, aren't you?" said
n04-107-05|Bawley." The truth is usually very embarra-
n04-107-06|ssing. You 're in submarines, aren't you?"
n04-107-07|" You know a great deal about me,"
n04-107-08|said John.
n04-114-00|" It 's my business. I 'll tell you more. You 're
n04-114-01|going to take over command of Pericles. Am I
n04-114-02|right?" " Who told you?" " Little bird.
n04-114-03|Other half?" John nodded." On me." Bawley
n04-114-04|shook his head." All paid for by His Lordship,"
n04-114-05|he said." Expense account. You 're a married
n04-114-06|man with a couple of kids. Can't go wasting
n04-114-07|your substance on a complete stranger. Set
n04-114-08|'em up, darling!"
n04-130-00|John flushed." I 'm not in need of charity." " Come
n04-130-01|off it," said Bawley." The proprietor of the Daily
n04-130-02|Courier knows what 's going on. If he doesn't mind,
n04-130-03|why should you?" " I see." John took the
n04-130-04|refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
n04-130-05|companion." You want me to talk, is that it?"
n04-139-00|" You misjudge me," said Bawley." You have
n04-139-01|nothing to tell me, yet. But we 'll be meeting
n04-139-02|again, no doubt, and then you will have.
n04-139-03|Regard this as a softening-up process, and
n04-139-04|have dinner with me? On His Lordship,
n04-139-05|of course." " On one condition," said John.
n04-139-06|" Tell me who the little bird was." " Can't
n04-139-07|you guess? Whose portrait appears regularly
n04-139-08|in the shiny papers?"
n04-149-00|" You mean Munyard?" " Sure. Very useful
n04-149-01|contact, is our Robbie; he gives us the gen and
n04-149-02|we give him the publicity. ' The Honourable
n04-149-03|" Robbie" and friend ', what? You know the
n04-149-04|sort of thing." " You 'll get nothing out of me,"
n04-149-05|said John," but you can pay for my drinks
n04-149-06|if you want to, as long as you keep off
n04-149-07|Service matters."
n04-156-00|" Good-oh! One for the grill-room, darling, and
n04-156-01|tell George to bring in the 6carte du jour."
n04-156-02|Bawley was a man of his word. He kept
n04-156-03|away from Service matters, was an excellent
n04-156-04|host and a splendid raconteur. The evening
n04-156-05|passed all too quickly. As they parted in
n04-156-06|the vestibule the two men were well
n04-156-07|disposed towards each other.
n04-163-00|" Ever been to Fleet Street?" asked Bawley.
n04-163-01|" You should. Next time you 're in Town
n04-163-02|give me a ring at this number and I 'll
n04-163-03|take you round the pubs where most
n04-163-04|of the work is done." He held out a card.
n04-163-05|John took it and put it in his pocket.
n04-163-06|" Thanks," he said." If ever my missus
n04-163-07|lets me off the chain I 'll take you
n04-163-08|up on that.
n04-202-00|Glad I met you. Don't forget to give me a ring -
n04-202-01|any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley, what?"
n04-202-02|" I don't know when that will be," said John.
n04-202-03|" I shall be busy for a while, cleaning up after
n04-202-04|Master bloody Munyard." THERE were six submarines,
n04-202-05|lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse.
n04-202-06|Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
n04-202-07|sounded, for all of them were rumbling as they
n04-202-08|charged their electric batteries.
n04-209-00|A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
n04-209-01|through the open windows of the Captain's house. It
n04-209-02|pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
n04-209-03|Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
n04-209-04|a substantial breakfast. Although usually a very
n04-209-05|talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
n04-209-06|silences, for she knew they betokened a worry of
n04-209-07|some sort.
n04-213-00|There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
n04-213-01|affair of Parsifal. Harry had lost a good deal of weight.
n04-213-02|His normal placid and steady-going manner remained,
n04-213-03|but she could see that it no longer came naturally.
n04-213-04|It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
n04-213-05|to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine,
n04-213-06|though in peace time these happenings are few and
n04-213-07|far between.
n04-218-00|This is the testing time for all. The affair blows up into
n04-218-01|a national disaster and then when it is all over life
n04-218-02|must continue as before. During this period the Captain
n04-218-03|must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
n04-218-04|if nothing unusual has happened. Harry Turton had
n04-218-05|written letters to the bereaved, had visited many in the
n04-218-06|locality, had been interviewed by the Press, had driven
n04-218-07|his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
n04-218-08|usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
n04-218-09|suitable for such occasions.
n06-074-00|He rode down to where I was waiting. I was
n06-074-01|thinking what a skill he had for reading
n06-074-02|my mind." This would be as good a place
n06-074-03|for a hold-up as any," he said, reining in
n06-074-04|near me." Yes," I said." It 'll be here to-
n06-074-05|morrow as likely as not." I paused." Miss
n06-074-06|Jeannie 'll be on that coach, Dan."
n06-082-00|" Yes," he said." I know." " No harm must come
n06-082-01|to her, Dan." " She 'll be all right. It 's the
n06-082-02|men who 'll be after that coach I 'm interested
n06-082-03|in, Johnny." " I know. But if lead starts
n06-082-04|flying she might be in danger." " That 's so.
n06-082-05|But I reckon they 'll be too busy shooting at
n06-082-06|us to bother with the coach and the folks
n06-082-07|in it."
n06-092-00|" Maybe," I said." But we 've got to remember
n06-092-01|that girl all the time, Dan. I feel kind
n06-092-02|of responsible for her." " Of course," he said,
n06-092-03|giving me one of his strange looks. Then he
n06-092-04|turned the conversation." Let 's ride over
n06-092-05|and have a look at the mining camp.
n06-092-06|After all it 's them we 're supposed to be
n06-092-07|working for, as well as the townsfolk and
n06-092-08|the agency detective."
n06-100-00|With something of a start I remembered the
n06-100-01|man who 'd brought us into this business.
n06-100-02|" Maybe you don't know about Appleton,
n06-100-03|Dan?" " Know what?" " That he 's dead,"
n06-100-04|I said. I watched him because I was always
n06-100-05|fascinated by the way he looked when you
n06-100-06|tried to surprise him." Dead?" he said." Yes.
n06-100-07|Dead. Shuffled out of the deck. Blasted
n06-100-08|down with a shotgun outside the Palace
n06-100-09|last night."
n06-111-00|" Fenton or Somers," he said." Or the Town
n06-111-01|Marshal," I added. His face was fixed,
n06-111-02|unreadable as a rock." Let 's get over to the
n06-111-03|mining camp," he said abruptly. He wheeled
n06-111-04|his horse back off the trail and up the slope
n06-111-05|leading to the ridge. I followed. From the
n06-111-06|top you could see something of the wild hill
n06-111-07|country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing.
n06-119-00|The air was fresh and clear and you
n06-119-01|could see far over west and north for many
n06-119-02|miles. The real high country of the Rockies
n06-119-03|lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
n06-119-04|colour drawing. Between us and that lay
n06-119-05|a vast stretch of hills, canyons, buttes and
n06-119-06|malpais.
n06-123-00|" The mine-workings lie north of the town,"
n06-123-01|said Dan." If we head west we ought to
n06-123-02|cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north."
n06-123-03|So we swung west, making slow going over
n06-123-04|rough country, sliding on shale, climbing down
n06-123-05|into draws, circling a big mesa by a
n06-123-06|four or five mile valley, sandy-floored. It
n06-123-07|got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
n06-123-08|gratefully by a small creek where we watered
n06-123-09|the horses and drank enough to cure our
n06-123-10|thirst.
n06-128-00|An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
n06-128-01|we figured would lead to the miners' camp.
n06-128-02|We turned north into it and after about four
n06-128-03|miles it led into a small canyon which
n06-128-04|opened out into a wide shallow draw.
n06-128-05|Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
n06-128-06|the miners at work. They were scattered
n06-128-07|over a fairly wide area working singly or
n06-128-08|in pairs.
n06-133-00|We didn't approach unchallenged. Just short
n06-133-01|of the diggings there was a roughly-built
n06-133-02|shack and as we got near someone inside bawled

n06-133-04|your whiskers off." " Take it easy, mister," I sang
n06-133-05|out." We don't aim to come any closer and we 've
n06-133-06|got no whiskers so as you can see. Just you
n06-133-07|go and tell Nick Dowd we 've come to talk
n06-133-08|to him about what happened last night."
n06-140-00|" Oh," said the unseen guard. He blew a
n06-140-01|whistle then, loud and shrill. The gun barrel
n06-140-02|peeking out through a hole in the shack never
n06-140-03|wavered. We sat our horses, waiting." Looks as
n06-140-04|though they 're expecting trouble," I said." Where
n06-140-05|there 's gold and women there 's always trouble,"
n06-140-06|observed Dan, shifting about in his saddle. He
n06-140-07|was never long on patience.
p01-147-00|Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side
p01-147-01|of the church where there was a small open
p01-147-02|outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades
p01-147-03|and forks and tidying up implements. It might
p01-147-04|be open. It was. He entered, and seated himself
p01-147-05|in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow.
p01-147-06|His curious headgear fell off. Strange things
p01-147-07|were going on in his bewildered brain. When
p01-147-08|a man was drowning and towards his last
p01-147-09|gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
p01-147-10|life came up before him in some cinematic
p01-147-11|kind of sequence.
p01-155-00|Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
p01-155-01|outbuilding, but this was happening to him now. He
p01-155-02|saw himself as a sulky, ugly, malformed, repressed
p01-155-03|boy, then a young youth. He saw himself refusing
p01-155-04|baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to.
p01-155-05|Walking out of the chapel later on. Continuing
p01-155-06|on, his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
p01-155-07|canery and corruption, the growth of the dea-
p01-155-08|dly decadence and absorption in debase-
p01-155-09|ment and Satanic debauchery.
p01-168-00|He didn't know what to make of it, but it
p01-168-01|was Mr. Copthorne all right. Perhaps he had
p01-168-02|been attending some kind of fancy dress do
p01-168-03|in London. Very strange his eyes looked. Mad,
p01-168-04|hunted eyes, as if the poor fellow had rocks in
p01-168-05|his head, so the verger described afterwards.
p01-168-06|" You 're very early about, sir," he said, trying to
p01-168-07|speak normally.
p01-174-00|" Yes. I travelled down from London
p01-174-01|as the dawn was breaking, and
p01-174-02|the thought came to me I 'd like
p01-174-03|to take a look at the church. I 've
p01-174-04|never been inside. Very remiss of
p01-174-05|me," said Mr. Copthorne. The verger
p01-174-06|led the way in." The stained glass
p01-174-07|windows, sir, they date back to
p01-174-08|the fourteenth century."
p02-000-00|There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
p02-000-01|quickly through the customs." Gay!" " Gavin!" The girl
p02-000-02|and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
p02-000-03|together. The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
p02-000-04|taxi." Just a moment, darling," Gavin pressed her
p02-000-05|hand and smiled." I want to check up on the
p02-000-06|flights back."
p02-008-00|Gay went out to the waiting
p02-008-01|taxi, and then found that in
p02-008-02|the excitement of meeting
p02-008-03|Gavin she had left her sun-
p02-008-04|glasses on the veranda. She
p02-008-05|went quickly back to fetch them.
p02-008-06|Gavin and the girl who had got
p02-008-07|off the plane with him were talking.
p02-008-08|He was writing something in his
p02-008-09|pocket-book, with a sick feeling
p02-008-10|of despair Gay knew that of course
p02-022-00|" And then we 'll go for a stroll along the
p02-022-01|beach. A moon like this mustn't be wasted."
p02-022-02|He gestured towards the bay where the full
p02-022-03|moon was just rising over the rocks, then
p02-022-04|laid his hand on hers. Gay smiled at him
p02-022-05|again, happy beyond belief, knowing that
p02-022-06|now Gavin was in love with her and her
p02-022-07|only, yet remembering for a second the
p02-022-08|kisses she had seen him giving Elaine.
p02-027-00|All that was part of the past, she would put it behind her. She
p02-027-01|would never be jealous again, would even take Larry's advice and
p02-027-02|look the other way if need be." I say!" Gavin was looking over her
p02-027-03|shoulder." That 's a pretty girl!" Gay glanced behind her," Isn't she
p02-027-04|lovely, she 's French, a very well known model I believe.
p02-069-00|Gay, a little puzzled, went through
p02-069-01|to the bar. Doc and Lilyan were
p02-069-02|sitting just inside having coffee.
p02-069-03|" Come and join us and bring your
p02-069-04|boy friend," Doc called." No, Doc!"
p02-069-05|Lilyan remonstrated." They want to be
p02-069-06|alone." " I 've booked a table at the
p02-069-07|cafe*?2," Doc said," they are packed
p02-069-08|tonight so come and join us if you
p02-069-09|can't find a table for two."
p02-076-00|Gay thanked him and walked out on to
p02-076-01|the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
p02-076-02|had bought a drink and taken it outside.
p02-076-03|She looked round scanning the tables,
p02-076-04|then caught her breath, a cold hand
p02-076-05|seeming to clutch her heart. Gavin was
p02-076-06|seated at a small table in a shadowy
p02-076-07|corner talking animatedly to Simone.
p02-076-08|As Gay watched he offered the girl a
p02-076-09|cigarette and lit it, his hands cupping
p02-076-10|hers in an intimate way.
p02-081-00|Gay stood irresolute for a moment, half
p02-081-01|decided to go back and join Lilyan and
p02-081-02|Doc, while she wanted to do no more than
p02-081-03|run upstairs to her room, knowing that
p02-081-04|Gavin although he had told her that he
p02-081-05|loved her, was already flirting with a girl
p02-081-06|that he had only met a few minutes before.
p02-081-07|Larry's advice flashed through her mind,
p02-081-08|but she turned away, giving a little
p02-081-09|gesture of hopelessness, knowing that her
p02-090-00|The others were all dancing and
p02-090-01|as Gay drew out a chair and sat
p02-090-02|down Gavin, without a word, swept
p02-090-03|Simone on to the floor." It doesn't mean
p02-090-04|anything," Gay told herself desperately,
p02-090-05|trying to understand Gavin's point of
p02-090-06|view and remembering the advice
p02-090-07|that Larry had given her, while she
p02-090-08|felt wretched beyond words.
p02-101-00|His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
p02-101-01|taste but it was unkind beyond words. She fumbled
p02-101-02|with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
p02-101-03|not wanting to smoke but needing some action
p02-101-04|to help her control her feelings." Come and
p02-101-05|dance," Doc's cheery voice came as a
p02-101-06|lifeline and Gay got up quickly, mana-
p02-101-07|ging a smile.
p02-105-00|As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
p02-105-01|and Simone go through the doorway that led
p02-105-02|down to the beach. Gay closed her eyes for a
p02-105-03|moment in disgust. She was fully aware that Gavin
p02-105-04|would make love to the French girl on the sands,
p02-105-05|and no doubt he would come back soon and
p02-105-06|after Simone had left expect her to accept his
p02-105-07|kisses on the way back to the hotel.

p02-109-02|" And that 's the man whom you have been eating your
p02-109-03|heart out over?" Doc nodded towards the door." You
p02-109-04|may consider him a man, I would say he was a
p02-109-05|mentally adolescent cad." " Oh, Doc..." Gay protested
p02-109-06|weakly," you don't know Gavin." " I 've only met him
p02-109-07|today but I think I can safely say that I know
p02-109-08|him a great deal better than you do."
p02-115-00|Doc gave her hand a shake." Wake up
p02-115-01|Gay, and don't even contemplate throwing
p02-115-02|yourself away on a chap like that. You 're a
p02-115-03|fine girl, intelligent, and pretty, and I had
p02-115-04|thought you were sensible too. Don't
p02-115-05|make a fool of yourself over someone
p02-115-06|who doesn't care two jots for your feelings.
p02-115-07|If he behaves like this now what is your
p02-115-08|married life going to be like?
p02-135-00|Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
p02-135-01|again Gay found herself alone at the table
p02-135-02|feeling self-conscious and awkward, sure that
p02-135-03|people were talking about the way Gavin
p02-135-04|was behaving since they had seen them
p02-135-05|dining together. She opened her bag
p02-135-06|to get out her compact and saw Grace's
p02-135-07|letter. She drew it out and opened it,
p02-135-08|glad to be able to occupy herself.
p02-139-00|" So glad that you are having such a lovely time, dearie,"
p02-139-01|it ran." Your cards are lovely. I rang up Miss Harland
p02-139-02|and have been over to sit with her father and do what
p02-139-03|I can for him so that she can get out to do her shopping.
p02-139-04|He 's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his
p02-139-05|broken arm.
p02-144-00|No other news except that Elaine is engaged
p02-144-01|and going to marry a foreigner..."
p02-144-02|Gay read the rest of the letter then put
p02-144-03|it back in her bag. Elaine was engaged,
p02-144-04|to the man she had spent so much time
p02-144-05|with at her party. That was why
p02-144-06|Gavin had come back to her.
p02-144-07|Everything was quite clear now, and to
p02-144-08|her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak,
p02-144-09|rather a sense of relief now that she
p02-144-10|knew why Gavin had come to see
p02-144-11|her.
p02-150-00|Because she was second best. The others came back
p02-150-01|to the table, all of them making a fuss of her and at once
p02-150-02|she felt happier. Gay loved them for their warm sympathy,
p02-150-03|knowing that they were real friends, even if they were new ones.
p02-150-04|" That is a pretty dress," Lilyan commented, obviously sensing
p02-150-05|Gay's distress and in a way that Doc, as a man, could not
p02-150-06|understand, knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
p02-150-07|for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she
p02-150-08|was hurt for herself.
p03-012-00|" There are all sorts of wonder-
p03-012-01|ful jobs in London and I could
p03-012-02|take my pick, whereas in Yarmouth
p03-012-03|one has to know something about fishing
p03-012-04|and in Liverpool they 'd want sea-farers.
p03-012-05|I don't think I 'd go to Edinburgh un-
p03-012-06|less I was a Scot and wanting to get
p03-012-07|home, or perhaps a student studying to
p03-012-08|be a doctor, and I already know
p03-012-09|all about that."
p03-023-00|She was engaged to Nigel, had been for two years.
p03-023-01|Sometimes they talked on the theme of" when we get married",
p03-023-02|and then all was wonderful, and perhaps it had only been
p03-023-03|a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said, only last
p03-023-04|evening," If we get married, old girl, you 'll have to stop
p03-023-05|that lark, I can tell you!"
p03-027-00|She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or
p03-027-01|which ' lark ' she would have to stop, only that significant tiny
p03-027-02|word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning, and
p03-027-03|with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information,
p03-027-04|which now took on an ominous significance: Nigel had been
p03-027-05|seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
p03-027-06|been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
p03-027-07|Little Phelpham.
p03-029-00|Now Nigel had every right to go where he
p03-029-01|liked during his off-duty periods
p03-029-02|when she was not free; this much they had
p03-029-03|conceded one to the other. They rarely
p03-029-04|found they were off duty together, and
p03-029-05|the situation would have been intolerable
p03-029-06|had there not been some give and take
p03-029-07|about their relationship. So when Nigel
p03-029-08|had told her about taking Luke's
p03-029-09|evening surgery she had said,
p03-033-00|" Bless you! I hope Luke is suitably grateful, darling." " Oh, well,"
p03-033-01|he shrugged diffidently," I like the work. One gets plenty
p03-033-02|of variety and it 's a change." Nigel was the hospital's
p03-033-03|Junior Medical Officer." You won't be free about nine, I
p03-033-04|suppose, to meet me for supper somewhere?" she had
p03-033-05|asked hopefully.
p03-040-00|" Hardly likely, my sweet. Luke's surgery goes on for
p03-040-01|hours. If they get in before eight-thirty, even
p03-040-02|though they 're standing on one another's toes,
p03-040-03|I 've got to see 'em. If I am free, though,
p03-040-04|I 'll give you a ring, O.K.?" O.K.," she had
p03-040-05|replied readily. So how could Nigel have
p03-040-06|been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse,
p03-040-07|dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
p03-040-08|very evening?
p03-047-00|" No," she told Phil Gubbins, a junior
p03-047-01|houseman," it wasn't Nigel you saw,
p03-047-02|my lad." " It was Nigel's car, anyway.
p03-047-03|NUF 121." " He probably loaned his car
p03-047-04|to somebody, Phil. He 's always doing that."
p03-047-05|Young Gubbins shrugged." I didn't see his
p03-047-06|face, Di, but it certainly looked like
p03-047-07|Nigel from the back. D.j. and all.
p03-047-08|Of course such as I couldn't afford
p03-047-09|to go into the Load of Trouble."
p03-072-00|" 5Ye-es?" he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
p03-072-01|mouth, an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge.
p03-072-02|" What about it, my sweet?" " Well," she laughed
p03-072-03|suddenly in an upsurging of relief," that stupid
p03-072-04|Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble.
p03-072-05|With a blonde, too. Imagine!" Nigel was frowning. He
p03-072-06|looked distinguished when he frowned; boyishly
p03-072-07|handsome at other times.
p03-080-00|" Gubbins? Gubbins?" he fretted." Who 's he?"
p03-080-01|Though Diana knew the name of every
p03-080-02|member of the staff, distinguished or not,
p03-080-03|Nigel often had to think hard to sort
p03-080-04|them out." He 's the carrotty lad, isn't he?"
p03-080-05|he now demanded." What was he
p03-080-06|doing at the Load of Trouble?"
p03-163-00|" But I want it!" she protested." It 's my ring."
p03-163-01|" You just gave it back to me." " I
p03-163-02|didn't! I was joking. You know I was
p03-163-03|joking, Nigel." " You shouldn't joke
p03-163-04|about serious things like engagements."
p03-163-05|" Don't be such a baby!" They were going
p03-163-06|to have an open quarrel
p03-163-07|any minute, and she knew it.
p03-173-00|Almost in desperation she appealed," Will you meet
p03-173-01|me at the gate, four o'clock tomorrow?" " Why?" he
p03-173-02|enquired, combing his thick, tawny hair." To bring
p03-173-03|me up for tea, of course. I just thought." " I 'll see,"
p03-173-04|he told her, and suddenly seized her in an embrace
p03-173-05|which really hurt." Without your ring it 's just like
p03-173-06|kissing somebody else's girl," he decided wickedly,
p03-173-07|and kissed her again, somewhat startled to
p03-173-08|receive a sharp slap for his pains.
p03-181-00|" If I were somebody else's girl that 's
p03-181-01|what you 'd get," she flashed at him, and
p03-181-02|so had left him, on her dignity and not
p03-181-03|seeing the look of admiration and revelation
p03-181-04|which had followed her slim young figure
p03-181-05|out of his sight." Mine," Nigel Lester had
p03-181-06|decided with a sigh of satisfaction, and
p03-181-07|then regarded the ring which he retrieved
p03-181-08|from his pocket." At a price," he concluded,
p03-181-09|with some bitterness.

p03-189-01|They often had such a rendezvous, for
p03-189-02|there was just time to smoke a cigarette,
p03-189-03|if one walked slowly, between road and
p03-189-04|hospital.
p06-030-00|His mouth hardened, his eyes became

p06-042-02|room filled him with a re-
p06-042-03|vulsion that was homicidal.

p06-047-06|waistcoat pocket, take out
p06-047-07|his # prescription pad, and
p06-047-08|# scribble on it. Then,
p06-047-09|with a gesture she knew so well,
p06-047-10|he tore off the leaflet and
p06-052-00|' Good-bye, Sandra, ' he said
p06-052-01|with a deadly finality. Watching
p06-052-02|him go, unable to speak, she
p06-052-03|felt that part of her was leaving

p06-058-06|where was happiness, or
p06-058-07|peace of mind? Philip put out
p06-058-08|a hand and grasped hers.
p06-058-09|He needed her. She would find
p06-058-10|solace in that fact at least.
p06-069-00|She had her truth. How much had built
p06-069-01|up from that first ideal, and how
p06-069-02|little joy, or satisfaction, it had
p06-069-03|given her. ' I 'm sorry, darling. '

p06-069-05|hell lying there, knowing she was
p06-069-06|talking to Nicholas and wondering
p06-069-07|what they were saying. Sandra
p06-069-08|said instinctively: ' I told him
p06-069-09|I knew he was responsible for
p06-069-10|Beryl's death. '

p06-088-05|no matter how one might want to
p06-088-06|disbelieve the facts. ' Elation
p06-088-07|touched him after the cold wind
p06-088-08|of suspense. ' It will be interesting
p06-088-09|to see what comes out at the inquest.

r03-053-03|the result being somehow as ineffective, not
r03-053-04|just dusty-grey but muddy, slimy even.
r03-053-05|His digressions too, seemed to have no other
r03-053-06|purpose than the throwing of dust in his
r03-053-07|client's eyes, the dust of fake security, of
r03-053-08|the fake friend of the family, like the
