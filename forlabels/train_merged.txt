a01-063u-00|But he said discussions" on a higher

a01-063u-02|The President will probably discuss the
a01-063u-03|problem with Dr. Brentano, the West German
a01-063u-04|Foreign Minister, who is due in Washington
a01-063u-05|next week. A big slice of Germany's" aid"
a01-063u-06|is the early payment of a 210million
a01-063u-07|debt to America. United States officials

a01-068u-00|And they are unimpressed by the Germans' claim
a01-068u-01|that they cannot pay more than 357million
a01-068u-02|without upsetting their own economy. The
a01-068u-03|Americans say Germany is having it too
a01-068u-04|good and is not paying for the past
a01-068u-05|or for the present. The Adenauer Government
a01-068u-06|flatly rejected attempts by the Eisenhower
a01-068u-07|Government to get them to pay a regular
a01-068u-08|sum towards the cost of keeping American
a01-068u-09|troops in Germany.
a01-072u-00|These support costs are a big drain on
a01-072u-01|America's dollar reserves. Dr. Adenauer's
a01-072u-02|answer is the once-and-for-all cash
a01-072u-03|offer of 357million. President Kennedy's
a01-072u-04|rejection of it is a painful blow to the
a01-072u-05|West German Government. It will now have
a01-072u-06|to pay more - and increase taxation to do
a01-072u-07|so - or run the obvious # risks in upsetting
a01-072u-08|the new American administration.

a01-077-00|And, since this is election year in West
a01-077-01|Germany, Dr. Adenauer is in a tough
a01-077-02|spot. Joyce Egginton cables: President
a01-077-03|Kennedy at his Washington Press con-
a01-077-04|ference admitted he did not know
a01-077-05|whether America was lagging behind
a01-077-06|Russia in missile power. He said he
a01-077-07|was waiting for his senior military
a01-077-08|aides to come up with the answer on
a01-077-09|February 20.

a01-082u-00|This surprising statement was a sharp about-

a01-082u-02|Presidential election campaign. He claimed
a01-082u-03|slackness in the Eisenhower Administration
a01-082u-04|had caused America to lag behind Russia
a01-082u-05|in nuclear development. President Kennedy
a01-082u-06|did his best to avoid giving Pressmen

a01-087-03|unemotional, replied with a statistical state-

a01-087-05|to angry uproar. One dealt with the human

a01-091-00|The result of the vote was not in

a01-096u-00|The Press, many doctors and public were
a01-096u-01|denouncing the proposals. He quoted from
a01-096u-02|this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received:
a01-096u-03|" My background is a doctor of 68, who
a01-096u-04|has practised medicine for 43 years, chiefly
a01-096u-05|as a panel doctor." I am a lifelong
a01-096u-06|Conservative. I am horrified and amazed
a01-096u-07|by my party's proposal to prostitute the
a01-096u-08|whole principle of the State service and
a01-096u-09|to render that service a hardship to poor
a01-096u-10|people.

a01-102-02|opinion is that anybody supporting

a01-102-04|old -." Mr. Brown went on:" We
a01-102-05|are dealing with a noble edifice which
a01-102-06|needs an imaginative architect to
a01-102-07|improve it, but it has got a

a01-102-09|from the real problems to fiddling about

a01-107-00|We believe that a comprehensive medical service, free to the patient
a01-107-01|at the point of need and with one standard for all sick
a01-107-02|people, is good and attainable." We remain for it. But the Tories
a01-107-03|never were." Interrupted by angry Tories, Mr. Brown retorted:

a01-113-00|He told them that their conception of social services was wholly
a01-113-01|different - fundamentally different from that of Labour. They
a01-113-02|would provide an ambulance service for the absolutely
a01-113-03|wretched - but it would not be too comfortable nor too easy to
a01-113-04|get. Answering jeers that it was Labour which first put a
a01-113-05|ceiling on health spending and started charges, Mr. Brown
a01-113-06|reminded the hostile Government benches that was
a01-113-07|done in 1950 because of the financial strain of
a01-113-08|the Korean war.

a01-117-00|In fact, the Tories made it worse now for the sick and
a01-117-01|needy than Labour had to make it in 1950. And
a01-117-02|as a percentage of social service expenditure,
a01-117-03|health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent.
a01-117-04|Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the
a01-117-05|unsmiling Mr. Powell. He demanded that instead
a01-117-06|of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should
a01-117-07|take ruthless action against the drug making
a01-117-08|industry, whose profits had risen by up to 400
a01-117-09|per cent. in the last eight years.

a01-122-03|full inquiry into the cost of drugs and the pharmaceutical
a01-122-04|industry." The health of children today owed much
a01-122-05|to the welfare food scheme. It was maintained
a01-122-06|during the war. Now in conditions of Tory

a01-128-06|" even after the proposed changes the net cost of the

a01-132-03|The Government decided to adjust

a01-132-05|claimed was underpinning - not
a01-132-06|undermining - the service. Answering the

a02-000-00|MR. Macmillan has picked a strong" brains trust"
a02-000-01|team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market.
a02-000-02|And he has abandoned plans to visit President de
a02-000-03|Gaulle this month to smooth the way. General
a02-000-04|de Gaulle's official welcome last week
a02-000-05|to Britain's moves towards the Six was
a02-000-06|taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall,
a02-000-07|but no more than that.
a02-004-00|So the idea of personal mission by
a02-004-01|the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped
a02-004-02|Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a
a02-004-03|hand-picked team under the leadership of
a02-004-04|Sir Pierson Dixon, Britain's Ambassador to
a02-004-05|France, to back Mr. Edward Heath, Lord
a02-004-06|Privy Seal, who is charged with the conduct
a02-004-07|of negotiations with the Six. At the same
a02-004-08|time the Prime Minister has offered
a02-004-09|Commonwealth Governments every facility possible to
a02-004-10|safeguard their interests
a02-008-00|Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys,
a02-008-01|Commonwealth Relations Secretary, that they wish to be kept
a02-008-02|in touch in London. Three of them - Canada, Australia,
a02-008-03|New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening
a02-008-04|meeting in London on Monday. Once the Common
a02-008-05|Market's Council of Ministers draws up the procedure
a02-008-06|for negotiations in a fortnight's time, these Commonwealth
a02-008-07|countries can arrange for observers to advise the British
a02-008-08|negotiating team.
a02-012-00|The team is composed of experienced
a02-012-01|negotiators in several fields. Sir Pier-
a02-012-02|son Dixon has a wide reputation as
a02-012-03|a skilful backstage negotiator since
a02-012-04|his days as Britain's chief UN dele-
a02-012-05|gate. Second in command is Mr.
a02-012-06|Eric Roll, 53-year-old Deputy Secre-
a02-012-07|tary at the Ministry of Agriculture,
a02-012-08|Food, and Fisheries. The Foreign Office
a02-012-09|is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay
a02-017-00|Other leading members are: Sir Henry Lintott from
a02-017-01|the Commonwealth Relations Office, Sir William
a02-017-02|Corell-Barnes ( Colonial Office), Mr. G. R. Bell
a02-017-03|( Treasury), and Mr. G. H. Andrew ( Board of Trade).
a02-017-04|They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when
a02-017-05|he goes to Brussels, headquarters of the Common
a02-017-06|Market Commission, or wherever the Six decide
a02-017-07|negotiations should be held.
a02-020-00|Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a
a02-020-01|meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville, French
a02-020-02|Foreign Minister, and Mr. Heath. MR. Selwyn Lloyd -
a02-020-03|a man with troubles enough back home - seems
a02-020-04|fated to fly into trouble abroad. Last year it was
a02-020-05|the riots in Istanbul, which enlivened the NATO
a02-020-06|Council meeting.
a02-024-00|Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in
a02-024-01|Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com-
a02-024-02|monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the
a02-024-03|first to be held in Africa. Only a few hours af-
a02-024-04|ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed
a02-024-05|at Accra this morning, hundreds of shop assistants
a02-024-06|demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway
a02-024-07|Stores, the largest in town.
a02-027-00|The stores had been hit by the same strike wave
a02-027-01|that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past
a02-027-02|week. Root of the discontent: The austerity Budget,
a02-027-03|including a compulsory savings scheme which the
a02-027-04|Ghana Government introduced in July. Ghana's strong
a02-027-05|man is not here to face the storm. President Nkrumah,
a02-027-06|having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference
a02-027-07|in Belgrade, has resumed his holiday on the Black
a02-027-08|Sea and no one here professes to know when he
a02-027-09|will return.
a02-032-00|But in his absence his chief lieutenants have
a02-032-01|not let him down. The strong arm of authority has
a02-032-02|been raised against the strikers and is now beginning
a02-032-03|to tell. Today's Ghanaian Times ( motto:" The welfare
a02-032-04|of the people is the supreme law") reports:" The
a02-032-05|Government has been urged to take immediate ac-
a02-032-06|tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers."
a02-037-00|The urge came from a conference of activists of
a02-037-01|Nkrumah's Convention Party" after powerful addresses
a02-037-02|by Comrades Krobo Edusei, Tawia Adamafio," and
a02-037-03|others. Strong deeds followed strong words. In Takoradi
a02-037-04|a" limited state of emergency" was declared, giving
a02-037-05|the Government adequate power to maintain all
a02-037-06|essential services and ensure food supplies. Thus it
a02-037-07|becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment
a02-037-08|for anyone who" publishes a report likely to cause
a02-037-09|alarm or prejudicial to public safety."
a02-042-00|And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed
a02-042-01|on anyone convicted of sabotage. These stern measures
a02-042-02|had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the
a02-042-03|strikers gave in, but in Takoradi, the chief storm centre,
a02-042-04|they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400
a02-042-05|police and 16 armoured cars. And how did the

a02-042-07|Accra?
a02-046-00|At 9.40 Mr. Edusei, Minister of Transport and pro-
a02-046-01|bably the toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah's team,
a02-046-02|drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the
a02-046-03|demonstrators, most of them shopgirls in overalls.
a02-046-04|" If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock," he
a02-046-05|told them, ' the police will act. ' At five to ten
a02-046-06|a posse of police arrived and in less than
a02-046-07|two minutes the crowd had gone.
a02-050-00|If the threatened" counter-revolution" was not * to bring
a02-050-01|the President back from his travels it might have been
a02-050-02|thought that the muster from the 13 States of the
a02-050-03|Commonwealth was an occasion worthy of his presence.
a02-050-04|After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this
a02-050-05|year the Economic Consultative Council should meet
a02-050-06|in Accra.
a02-050-07|* enough
a02-053-00|It has been left, however, to Mr. Goka, Ghana's Finance
a02-053-01|Minister, to do the honours as host, in which capacity
a02-053-02|he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador
a02-053-03|Hotel. POLICE, on direct orders from the Cabinet, are
a02-053-04|openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear-
a02-053-05|disarming Committee of 100, the Committee claimed
a02-053-06|yesterday. It said pressure was being put on
a02-053-07|members and associates all over the country.
a02-057-00|It alleged: Phones were being tapped and
a02-057-01|going out of action; Police were visiting
a02-057-02|people" on no pretext whatsoever, except
a02-057-03|to pass the time of day"; Supporters had
a02-057-04|been warned - one that his connection
a02-057-05|with the committee was going too far; another
a02-057-06|that anti-apartheid agitation was
a02-057-07|all right, but support for the committee
a02-057-08|was not.
a02-062-00|A third man's house was watched for four days
a02-062-01|by plain-clothes men. Committee-member Mr. George
a02-062-02|Clark commented at a Press conference:" The
a02-062-03|most extraordinary things are happening." Fifty
a02-062-04|committee members will appear at Bow-street
a02-062-05|today, including Lord Russell, Lady Russell,
a02-062-06|Lord Boyd-Orr, the Rev. Michael Scott, and
a02-062-07|Mr. Clark.
a02-067-00|They are required to show why they
a02-067-01|should not be bound over for disturbing
a02-067-02|the peace and for inciting a breach
a02-067-03|of the peace. The summonses say they
a02-067-04|are" likely to persevere in such unlawful
a02-067-05|conduct." Lord Russell, 89, was
a02-067-06|putting his affairs in order, and
a02-067-07|packing a case, at his Chelsea home
a02-067-08|yesterday. His secretary, American-born
a02-067-09|Mr. Ralph Schoenman, said:
a02-072-00|" He is not going to agree to be bound over. That will
a02-072-01|probably mean jail and, though frail, he is very fit and
a02-072-02|will take the rigours of prison in his stride. He
a02-072-03|hopes to be allowed to do some writing." Back at
a02-072-04|the Press conference, Mr. Clark said two committee
a02-072-05|members tried a" plant" call on suspect phone. They
a02-072-06|discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none
a02-072-07|was planned but police turned up.
a02-078-00|Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no
a02-078-01|longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Kenneth
a02-078-02|Kaunda. Sir Roy, Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister,
a02-078-03|said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence
a02-078-04|Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia
a02-078-05|National Congress, which was led by Mr. Kaunda
a02-078-06|until he was outlawed in 1959. The record
a02-078-07|of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went
a02-078-08|back a long way, Sir Roy told the
a02-078-09|Federal Parliament in Salisbury.
a02-082-00|He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters
a02-082-01|had been arrested or convicted since last year on
a02-082-02|charges of creating disturbances. During the first
a02-082-03|three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents
a02-082-04|had been reported in Northern Rhodesia. More
a02-082-05|than 500 people - 167 of them members of
a02-082-06|the UNIP - were convicted last month in the
a02-082-07|Northern Province alone.
a02-086-00|" Against this background must be taken Mr.
a02-086-01|Kaunda's repeated statements that all he is
a02-086-02|doing is in the name of non-violence," said
a02-086-03|Sir Roy." I am now compelled to say that
a02-086-04|I don't accept his good faith." He said
a02-086-05|Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements
a02-086-06|had stimulated violence, but he had done
a02-086-07|nothing to stop it.
a02-090-00|" It is true he made a point of again being absent
a02-090-01|from Northern Rhodesia when his followers have
a02-090-02|indulged in such violence." But Sir Roy pointed out
a02-090-03|that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that
a02-090-04|if UNIP did not get its way what would happen
a02-090-05|would make the Mau Mau in Kenya" seem like a
a02-090-06|child's picnic."
a02-093-00|JOHN DICKIE writes: Mr. Macmillan gave top
a02-093-01|priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his
a02-093-02|return from Scotland yesterday. He summoned Mr.
a02-093-03|Iain Macleod, Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Duncan Sandys,
a02-093-04|Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks
a02-093-05|at Admiralty House. A statement is expected today
a02-093-06|to hold the door open for modifications to the
a02-093-07|new Constitution provided law and order is maintained
a02-093-08|in Northern Rhodesia.
a02-098-00|Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting
a02-098-01|problem. Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a
a02-098-02|strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any
a02-098-03|suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the
a02-098-04|African nationalists. Mr. Macleod has ample evidence
a02-098-05|from talks with Sir John Moffat, Northern Rhodesian
a02-098-06|Liberal leader, and Mr. Kaunda, that the bulk
a02-098-07|of moderates and Africans will reject the
a02-098-08|Constitution unless it is modified.
a02-102-00|A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of
a02-102-01|Buganda ( King Freddie) from Princess
a02-102-02|Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro, kneeling at the
a02-102-03|foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport
a02-102-04|yesterday. Forty other Africans greeted him,
a02-102-05|kneeling with heads bowed. The princess,
a02-102-06|aged 24, is now studying history at Cambri-
a02-102-07|dge, where she is a friend of Prince William
a02-102-08|of Gloucester.
a02-106-00|King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of
a02-106-01|native kingdoms in Uganda arrived for talks with
a02-106-02|Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod, before the
a02-106-03|Uganda Constitutional conference opens next Monday.
a02-106-04|The question: Their status in an independent Uganda.
a02-106-05|The thorniest problem for next week's conference is
a02-106-06|to settle the relationships between them and the
a02-106-07|rest of the country. A Government report has
a02-106-08|recognised their rights and recommended a form of
a02-106-09|federal association, but the four kings are not
a02-111-00|Instead, the kings will remain in London
a02-111-01|and wait to hear the conference's proposals.
a02-111-02|Then their views will be transmitted back.
a02-111-03|MR. BUTLER, the Home Secretary, has decided
a02-111-04|to meet head-on the biggest challenge to
a02-111-05|Government authority yet presented by the
a02-111-06|" Ban-the-Bomb" demonstrators. Police leave
a02-111-07|has been cancelled and secret plans prepared
a02-111-08|to deal with the mass sit-down rally planned
a02-111-09|for Sunday in Parliament-square by the
a02-111-10|Committee of 100, the anti-nuclear arms
a02-111-11|group.
a02-116-00|It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which
a02-116-01|ended yesterday in 32 members of the
a02-116-02|Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting
a02-116-03|a breach of the peace. The committee's
a02-116-04|president 89-year-old Earl Russell and
a02-116-05|his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for
a02-116-06|a week. Playwrights Arnold Wesker ( The Kitchen)
a02-116-07|and Robert Bolt ( The Flowering Cherry) were
a02-116-08|jailed for a month.
a02-120-00|The possibility that the Government might
a02-120-01|invoke the Public Order Act, 1936, and
a02-120-02|declare the whole rally illegal - whether
a02-120-03|the demonstrators sit down or not - was
a02-120-04|being discussed in Whitehall last night.
a02-120-05|It was last used a year ago, to deal
a02-120-06|with the St. Pancras rent riots. Today
a02-120-07|Mr. Butler will have talks with Police
a02-120-08|Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to
a02-120-09|draw up final plans for the" Battle
a02-120-10|of Parliament Square."
a02-124-00|Measures agreed so far include: 1. A mass
a02-124-01|call-out of police, special constables
a02-124-02|and reserves, with 750 policemen posted
a02-124-03|from outlying districts to stations in
a02-124-04|the area - West End Central, Bow-street,
a02-124-05|and Cannon-row.
a03-006-00|Today, for example, the Foreign Minister of Indo-
a03-006-01|nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav
a03-006-02|Foreign Minister. In fact such Yugoslav activity has
a03-006-03|been # particularly intensified in the past year
a03-006-04|or so and though so far, apart from joint action
a03-006-05|in the United Nations, these exchanges have not
a03-006-06|been seen on any wider basis, President Tito
a03-006-07|is known for some time to have favoured a
a03-006-08|conference of neutralist leaders.
a03-009-00|The wish was particularly apparent in comments
a03-009-01|on the occasion of the conference in Casablanca and,
a03-009-02|in particular, in Yugoslav approval of the idea of an
a03-009-03|inter-African consultative assembly which would
a03-009-04|coordinate activity on the political and economic
a03-009-05|sphere; and it is not difficult to see that President
a03-009-06|Tito would like some such idea extended also
a03-009-07|to the whole uncommitted world
a03-011-00|But he now feels, in view of a changed international
a03-011-01|situation and especially in view of fresh problems facing
a03-011-02|the new and independent countries of Africa, that the
a03-011-03|time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between
a03-011-04|the uncommitted countries and even to work out common
a03-011-05|stands on various problems facing those nations. Two
a03-011-06|subjects, the Congo and Algeria, are the main topics
a03-011-07|of the talks in Belgrade - and on both the two
a03-011-08|leaders have identical ideas.
a03-014-00|Two emissaries from the Laotian Government
a03-014-01|of Prince Boun Oum have arrived in
a03-014-02|Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to invite Prince
a03-014-03|Souvanna Phouma, the former Prime Min-
a03-014-04|ister, to return to Laos. No details of
a03-014-05|their mission have been disclosed, but it
a03-014-06|was reported earlier in Laos that Prince
a03-014-07|Boun Oum was considering asking
a03-014-08|Prince Souvanna Phouma to join his
a03-014-09|Government.
a03-017-00|Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to
a03-017-01|the mission, but recent statements made by him
a03-017-02|in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards
a03-017-03|himself as the only legal Prime Minister of
a03-017-04|Laos. His policy of strict neutrality from 1951
a03-017-05|to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace, though
a03-017-06|at the cost of virtual partition of the country
a03-017-07|into the pro-communist north and the
a03-017-08|pro-western centre and south.
a03-020-00|Prince Souvanna's former Minister of
a03-020-01|Information, Mr. Quinim Pholsena, who
a03-020-02|claims to be his representative in
a03-020-03|Laos, yesterday addressed all officers
a03-020-04|of the pro-communist forces
a03-020-05|occupying the province of Xieng
a03-020-06|Khouang and emphasized that
a03-020-07|Prince Souphannouvong, leader
a03-020-08|of the pro-communist Neo Lao
a03-020-09|Haksat Party, also to the officers
a03-020-10|in the same terms.
a03-023-00|This emphasis on the legality of the former
a03-023-01|Government suggests that all is not well
a03-023-02|with the political and military leadership
a03-023-03|of the pro-communists. Most of the
a03-023-04|province of Xieng Khouang and the
a03-023-05|tactically useful Plain of Jars, however,
a03-023-06|appear still to be firmly in their hands.
a03-023-07|The Government has claimed the
a03-023-08|recapture of Vang Vieng, the pro-
a03-023-09|communists' former base 60 miles
a03-023-10|north of Vientiane, but this claim
a03-027-00|A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within
a03-027-01|a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by officers that
a03-027-02|this village was still held by the pro-communists.
a03-027-03|With the Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica
a03-027-04|and # his Cabinet out in the grass roots making
a03-027-05|160 speeches in 80 constituencies in 10 days, the Liberal
a03-027-06|Party are holding a national conference here with
a03-027-07|some 2,000 delegates, the biggest gathering since 1958
a03-027-08|when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party
a03-027-09|leader.
a03-030-00|In some ways it will be a testing occasion
a03-030-01|for him, although some think his position
a03-030-02|unassailable simply because there is no one
a03-030-03|else in sight to supplant him. So the con-
a03-030-04|ference will concentrate on laying the
a03-030-05|foundations on which to win the next
a03-030-06|election. The rally comes at a time
a03-030-07|when in spite of carefully worded state-
a03-030-08|ments by the Prime Minister there is an
a03-030-09|air of electoral expectancy.
a03-034-00|Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
a03-034-01|a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
a03-034-02|which outlines in some detail the accomplishments
a03-034-03|of the party since it came to office three and
a03-034-04|a half years ago. Nevertheless there is little
a03-034-05|illusion in the Conservative Party that their
a03-034-06|stock at home has fallen in the face of
a03-034-07|heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy.
a03-037-00|Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
a03-037-01|provincial governments, Quebec and New Brunswick, and
a03-037-02|in the four federal by-elections last October the party
a03-037-03|fared badly. They are now faced with four other by-
a03-037-04|elections, one at Esquimalt Saanich, British Columbia,
a03-037-05|one in Leeds, Ontario, and the other two in the
a03-037-06|Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska, New Brunswick,
a03-037-07|and Kings, Prince Edward Island.
a03-040-00|All four were Conservative strongholds. Last September
a03-040-01|a public poll showed that for the first time since
a03-040-02|the Administration came to power in 1957 the
a03-040-03|Liberals were ahead ( 43 per cent were in favour
a03-040-04|of" The Grits" if a federal election had been
a03-040-05|held last autumn, 38 per cent for the
a03-040-06|Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F.).
a03-043-00|However, a separate poll revealed that Mr.
a03-043-01|Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
a03-043-02|popularity as an individual leader ( for
a03-043-03|Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent, for Mr.
a03-043-04|Pearson 34 per cent). How far is Mr.
a03-043-05|Lester Pearson acceptable to the people
a03-043-06|of Canada as a Prime Minister? Many
a03-043-07|observers at the national rally will be
a03-043-08|seeking an answer.
a03-047-00|It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
a03-047-01|in the role of a popular orator at the
a03-047-02|hustings, the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-
a03-047-03|baker was in the last two campaigns. The
a03-047-04|impression remains that the Liberal leader
a03-047-05|is still the diplomatist, more at home
a03-047-06|in the chancery, or the corridors of the United
a03-047-07|Nations, not the father figure, so necessary
a03-047-08|in Canadian leadership, or the practical
a03-047-09|politician, able to talk about sewage problems
a03-047-10|in Algoma East.
a03-050-00|On the other hand, Mr. Pearson excels
a03-050-01|in meeting people informally, but many
a03-050-02|still regard him" as some sort of cross
a03-050-03|between an egghead and a missionary".
a03-050-04|His party advisers are now trying to
a03-050-05|correct that image. The bow tie has
a03-050-06|gone; he is having lessons on
a03-050-07|television techniques and is being coached
a03-050-08|by speech experts.
a03-054-00|Everything is being done to promote
a03-054-01|a new image. Certainly, he is now a
a03-054-02|much lessly trounced by Mr. Diefen-
a03-054-03|baker in the House in those early
a03-054-04|days. It has been a hard road back
a03-054-05|but now, with plenty of political
a03-054-06|ammunition given him by the Gov-
a03-054-07|ernment in recent sessions, he is
a03-054-08|leading the Opposition with skill and
a03-054-09|assurance and is a match for the
a03-054-10|Prime Minister across the floor.

a03-059-01|Mr. Pearson is now talking about" his

a03-059-04|will go. The main topic under review is

a03-063-01|Mr. Thorneycroft, the Minister of Aviation, who arrives in
a03-063-02|Bonn tomorrow for talks with the Federal Government on a
a03-063-03|European space satellite project, will find the Germans
a03-063-04|interested in the principle of space research, but rather
a03-063-05|sceptical about British plans for organizing it.
a03-063-06|Stated more bluntly, they are still unconvinced that
a03-063-07|this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to
a03-063-08|salve Blue Streak, which was abandoned last summer
a03-063-09|as a military project; or that the European space satellite
a03-063-10|is indeed to be purely scientific in character.
a03-066-00|Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to
a03-066-01|remove these doubts, and to persuade the
a03-066-02|Federal Government that the financial burden
a03-066-03|involved is really worth while, at a time when
a03-066-04|any increase in budgetary commitments
a03-066-05|would almost certainly involve a corresponding
a03-066-06|rise in taxation - something no one is prepared
a03-066-07|to contemplate in an election year.
a03-071-00|But, at the same time, there is reason to
a03-071-01|believe that the Federal Government is not
a03-071-02|convinced, on the basis of the information
a03-071-03|it has so far, that such a project would
a03-071-04|be justified from a scientific point of view;
a03-071-05|and not merely constitute a" prestige"
a03-071-06|satellite, duplicating to some extent American
a03-071-07|efforts, as Die Welt suggests today in
a03-071-08|a highly critical editorial article.
a03-073-00|On the specific question of the use of Blue
a03-073-01|Streak, Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be
a03-073-02|easier. He can point out that this is the
a03-073-03|only rocket and launcher in Europe to
a03-073-04|have reached a sufficient stage of development
a03-073-05|for adaptation as the first stage in
a03-073-06|putting a heavy satellite into outer space.
a03-073-07|There has also been some talk of adopting another
a03-073-08|British rocket, Black Knight, for the second
a03-073-09|stage, but the French have one of their
a03-073-10|own called Veronique which they would
a03-073-11|like to see used.
a03-080-00|The Foreign Ministry spokesman added
a03-080-01|today, however, that the Brussels Treaty
a03-080-02|was irrelevant, because research on the
a03-080-03|various rocket stages had already been
a03-080-04|concluded, and only cooperation on the type
a03-080-05|of capsule was involved. A lesser obstacle
a03-080-06|to German participation is the absence of
a03-080-07|any Ministry or Minister directly responsible
a03-080-08|for it - and therefore of any budget
a03-080-09|under which funds could be appropriated.
a03-089-00|This is expected eventually to replace the
a03-089-01|Fiat G-91, and the F 104 Starfighter,
a03-089-02|the backbone of the German Air
a03-089-03|Force.
a04-000-00|PRESIDENT KENNEDY renewed his pressure
a04-000-01|on Mr. Harold Macmillan to join the
a04-000-02|Common Market during their talks at Admiralty
a04-000-03|House, Whitehall, yesterday. Much of their
a04-000-04|three hours, 20 minutes of discussion is believed
a04-000-05|to have been devoted to this main point
a04-000-06|of American policy.
a04-003-00|It arose during talks following
a04-003-01|President Kennedy's report to the British
a04-003-02|Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent
a04-003-03|visit to Paris. There General de Gaulle had made
a04-003-04|clear that he would accept Britain into the
a04-003-05|Common Market only if there were no conditions
a04-003-06|laid down to meet the Commonwealth
a04-003-07|and other reservations.
a04-006-00|Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still
a04-006-01|wanted him to apply for membership of the Common
a04-006-02|Market, even if it meant an unconditional surrender.
a04-006-03|There were also brief discussions on Laos, Berlin
a04-006-04|and other foreign questions, after Mr. Kennedy had
a04-006-05|informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr.
a04-006-06|Krushchov. With the exception of 40 minutes when
a04-006-07|Lord Home, Foreign Secretary, and Mr. McGeorge
a04-006-08|Bundy, the President's special assistant for
a04-006-09|security affairs, were brought in, the two
a04-006-10|men talked alone.
a04-010-00|An attempt to get more information about the
a04-010-01|Admiralty House meeting will be made in the
a04-010-02|House of Commons this afternoon. Labour M.P.s already
a04-010-03|have many questions to the Prime Minister asking
a04-010-04|for a statement. President Kennedy flew from London
a04-010-05|Airport last night to arrive in Washington this
a04-010-06|morning. He is to make a 30-minute nation-wide
a04-010-07|broadcast and television report on his
a04-010-08|talks with Mr. Krushchov this evening.
a04-015-00|The joint communique on Mr. Kennedy's and Mr. Macmillan's
a04-015-01|third talks - the first were at Key West, Florida, the second in
a04-015-02|Washington - said:" Their discussions covered the major problems,
a04-015-03|both economic and political, and revealed once again the
a04-015-04|close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their
a04-015-05|common purposes." Occasion was given to review the need for
a04-015-06|economic co-operation and expansion in the general interests
a04-015-07|of developed and underdeveloped countries alike."
a04-019-00|It said that the President and Premier noted" with satisfaction" the
a04-019-01|agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective Laos ceasefire,
a04-019-02|which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement at the
a04-019-03|Geneva conference." Particular attention was also given to the
a04-019-04|nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament." The
a04-019-05|situation in regard to Germany was reviewed, and there was full
a04-019-06|agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and
a04-019-07|obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin."
a04-023-00|Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks, followed by lunch
a04-023-01|given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other
a04-023-02|guests present, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more
a04-023-03|times yesterday. In PARIS, Mr. Dean Rusk, U.S. Secretary of
a04-023-04|State, gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the
a04-023-05|15-nation Nato council. Some of his listeners said he was
a04-023-06|" rather pessimistic" and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year.
a04-027-00|From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President de Gaulle
a04-027-01|and informed him of the Vienna outcome. Last night Mr. Rusk arrived
a04-027-02|in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
a04-027-03|fly home with the President. In DUESSELDORF, Chancellor Adenauer
a04-027-04|said the Vienna talks" might be the beginning of a slight improvement,"
a04-027-05|but no big changes should be expected in the political situation.
a04-031-00|RELAXED, smiling and clearly in the best of
a04-031-01|spirits, Mr. Krushchov yesterday returned to
a04-031-02|Moscow after his two days of talks with President
a04-031-03|Kennedy, writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow. The
a04-031-04|good beginning made at Vienna must be
a04-031-05|followed up by new efforts for peace, the
a04-031-06|Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda
a04-031-07|declared yesterday. Events in Vienna" gave hope
a04-031-08|to people of goodwill who hate the cold war,
a04-031-09|and to all who are striving for a stable peace,"
a04-035-00|" Thinking over the results of the Vienna
a04-035-01|meeting, peace-loving people will say ' a
a04-035-02|good beginning. '" Mr. Krushchov remained at the
a04-035-03|airport to join President Brezhnev in welcoming
a04-035-04|Dr. Sukarno, President and Prime Minister of
a04-035-05|Indonesia, who arrived by Boeing 707 jet on a
a04-035-06|state visit 40 minutes after Mr. Khrushchov had
a04-035-07|arrived from Vienna. A cheering, delighted crowd
a04-035-08|of Indonesian students broke through crash barriers
a04-035-09|to surround their President on the tarmac for
a04-039-00|In VIENNA, before flying off to Moscow,
a04-039-01|Mr. Khrushchov said he hoped his weekend
a04-039-02|talks with President Kennedy would # help" to
a04-039-03|establish an enduring peace between nations."
a04-039-04|Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President
a04-039-05|Schaerf, the Soviet Premier thanked Austria for
a04-039-06|the hospitality and welcome he had received.
a04-039-07|" The Soviet Union has always striven and is
a04-039-08|striving to safeguard an enduring peace for
a04-039-09|the peoples, to secure an early solution of the
a04-043-00|MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded
a04-043-01|defence of the Polaris missile base. And by
a04-043-02|implication he supported the establishment of
a04-043-03|sites in Britain for the training of German
a04-043-04|troops. His main theme was that nuclear
a04-043-05|weapons were necessary to defend Britain, that
a04-043-06|Britain must depend on Nato and" the West"
a04-043-07|must have nuclear weapons so long as the
a04-043-08|Soviet Union has them.
a04-047-00|Addressing the annual congress of the National Union
a04-047-01|of General and Municipal Workers, he said he felt
a04-047-02|sure the Labour movement was coming round in
a04-047-03|support of his views. Obviously conscious of the fierce and
a04-047-04|widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
a04-047-05|Britain, Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that
a04-047-06|supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
a04-047-07|their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
a04-047-08|to the missile.
a04-050-00|Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
a04-050-01|not deny facilities to nations to which it was
a04-050-02|allied. But governments should be free to negotiate
a04-050-03|and refuse proposals with which they did not
a04-050-04|agree. The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles, because,
a04-050-05|he said, they were out of date and vulnerable and
a04-050-06|would attract enemy action.
a04-054-00|That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine.
a04-054-01|So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons,
a04-054-02|the West, somewhere, must have them too. It
a04-054-03|was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
a04-054-04|purposes to be under the sea rather than on land.
a04-054-05|This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
a04-054-06|to oppose the Polaris depot ship.
a04-059-00|The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
a04-059-01|in the Holy Loch, only 30 miles from Glasgow, a
a04-059-02|city with two million people. It should be sited
a04-059-03|in a more remote area. Mr. Gaitskell added that
a04-059-04|the Scarborough conference decisions did not, in his
a04-059-05|view, truly reflect the opinions of the majority
a04-059-06|of party members and still less the party's
a04-059-07|supporters in the country.
a04-066-00|Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
a04-066-01|unilateralists was not possible, though
a04-066-02|he respected their views. He saw by reports
a04-066-03|that" those who organise these things" were
a04-066-04|recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear
a04-066-05|disarmament to shift the emphasis of
a04-066-06|their intervention away from straight opposition
a04-066-07|to the official document on to opposition
a04-066-08|to the Polaris base.
a04-069-00|To Mr. Macmillan, Mr Gaitskell said the
a04-069-01|Prime Minister should begin to take
a04-069-02|seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
a04-069-03|weapons within the Nato alliance." Let us say
a04-069-04|to Macmillan that he should press, I hope
a04-069-05|with the agreement of Kennedy, in
a04-069-06|talks with the Soviet Union, for the establishment
a04-069-07|in central Europe of a zone of controlled
a04-069-08|disarmament."
a04-072-00|He thought, he said, that the Soviet
a04-072-01|Union would be prepared to reach
a04-072-02|an agreement on a zone of controlled
a04-072-03|disarmament in Europe. Mr Gaitskell
a04-072-04|concluded, declaring that the present
a04-072-05|was the beginning of a great period of
a04-072-06|opportunity for the party. It was a
a04-072-07|great chance that should be grasped.
a04-072-08|Inter-union jealousies prevent the
a04-072-09|fulfilment of a common policy for wages
a04-072-10|and other major questions, Mr. Jack Cooper
a04-081-00|The General Council of the Trades Union
a04-081-01|Congress should therefore consider the
a04-081-02|matter. Consideration should also be given
a04-081-03|to the regrouping of unions and the
a04-081-04|modification of their structures to
a04-081-05|meet the growing concentration of
a04-081-06|capital. Mr. Cooper argued that a
a04-081-07|common industrial contribution was
a04-081-08|urgent - particularly in unions serving
a04-081-09|workers in the same industry - along
a04-085-00|Suggesting that a total T.U.C.
a04-085-01|membership of eight million was a" poor
a04-085-02|show" compared with some countries, he
a04-085-03|argued that the position needed examination.
a04-085-04|BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr.
a04-085-05|Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
a04-085-06|the views of a wide section of the
a04-085-07|British people about Polaris submarine
a04-085-08|bases in this country. An open letter
a04-085-09|written by Earl Russell hoping that the
a04-089-00|Earl Russell, President of the Committee
a04-089-01|of 100, told Kennedy that he should
a04-089-02|take notice of" that very large and
a04-089-03|growing section which is opposed to
a04-089-04|the establishment of a Polaris base,
a04-089-05|whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
a04-089-06|British territory." He pointed out that
a04-089-07|already there have been protests but
a04-089-08|that" very much larger protests are to
a04-089-09|be expected and are being planned."
a04-092-00|There are three kinds of reasons that justify
a04-092-01|the protests and these should carry weight with
a04-092-02|the U.S. Government, Earl Russell suggested." The
a04-092-03|first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
a04-092-04|serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
a04-092-05|U.S. and Great Britain, not only in Government
a04-092-06|circles, but in public opinion." Earl Russell
a04-092-07|says it is inevitable, though profoundly
a04-092-08|regrettable, that the agitation against
a04-092-09|the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
a04-092-10|to the policy of the United States.
a04-096-00|The second reason is concerned with doubts
a04-096-01|as to the safety of the people of Great Britain;
a04-096-02|" in the time of crisis it would probably be
a04-096-03|impossible for the British authorities to
a04-096-04|exercise any degree of control over the action
a04-096-05|of Polaris submarines." He argues that
a04-096-06|there is a distinct possibility that so long
a04-096-07|as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
a04-096-08|Soviet Union might retaliate against
a04-096-09|Britain alone.
a04-099-00|" Such retaliation might, and probably would,
a04-099-01|destroy the whole population of Britain in
a04-099-02|the course of, at the most, an hour" without
a04-099-03|provoking American retaliation. Earl Russell
a04-099-04|believes:" It is very questionable whether
a04-099-05|British membership of Nato and British
a04-099-06|permission of American bases on our territory
a04-099-07|add anything to the strength of America,
a04-099-08|while, on the contrary, they impose upon
a04-099-09|America an onerous obligation which it
a04-099-10|may prove impossible to fulfil."
a04-103-00|The third reason is that the supreme
a04-103-01|interest for the whole world - East and
a04-103-02|West and uncommitted nations - is the
a04-103-03|prevention of nuclear war." A rapidly
a04-103-04|growing body of opinion in this country
a04-103-05|believes that Britain could be more effective
a04-103-06|in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
a04-103-07|by helping to suggest agreements which could
a04-103-08|be accepted by both East and West."
a05-000-00|THE next White Paper on defence, to
a05-000-01|be published in March, is likely to
a05-000-02|contain a five-year plan for the three
a05-000-03|Services. Its aim will be to produce superbly
a05-000-04|equipped, all-Regular forces of
a05-000-05|about 400,000 men. The three Services
a05-000-06|would be" integrated" to a greater
a05-000-07|extent than ever before.
a05-004-00|Short of wearing the same uniform, which is
a05-004-01|not contemplated, the Navy, Army and Royal
a05-004-02|Air Force would become, for practical purposes,
a05-004-03|a single defence force. There would be
a05-004-04|complete co-operation at all levels in training
a05-004-05|and operations. This would apply also in the
a05-004-06|command structure and central administrative
a05-004-07|organisation. Mr. Watkinson, Minister of Defence,
a05-004-08|has been working on the plan for some months,
a05-004-09|with the Prime Minister's approval.
a05-009-00|He has had numerous meetings with the Service
a05-009-01|Ministers. He has also had talks with the Earl
a05-009-02|of Home, Foreign Secretary, and with other
a05-009-03|Ministers concerned with overseas aspects
a05-009-04|of defence policy. Details of the scheme
a05-009-05|are now being worked out by the Chiefs
a05-009-06|of Staff, a process that may take four
a05-009-07|or five months.
a05-013-00|The scheme will be subject to Cabinet
a05-013-01|approval. Mr. Watkinson remains con-
a05-013-02|vinced that the policy initiated in
a05-013-03|1957, in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister
a05-013-04|of Defence, is still correct. This was to
a05-013-05|return to the tradition of all-Regular
a05-013-06|voluntary forces, with the last National
a05-013-07|Serviceman out of uniform by the end
a05-013-08|of 1962.
a05-017-00|The Minister regards the recent trend
a05-017-01|of recruiting figures as encouraging.
a05-017-02|He is confident the aim can be achieved.
a05-017-03|While the possibility of an eventual return
a05-017-04|to National Service in some form
a05-017-05|cannot be entirely discounted, he does
a05-017-06|not agree that the point has been reached
a05-017-07|where this need even be considered. If
a05-017-08|National Service is ever resorted to,
a05-017-09|engagement would probably have to be for
a05-017-10|three years.
a05-022-00|It is thought this would be the minimum
a05-022-01|necessary for the extended training modern
a05-022-02|arms require and to enable each man to
a05-022-03|serve at least a year overseas. There is
a05-022-04|no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
a05-022-05|is at odds with the Service chiefs over
a05-022-06|the decision to dispense with National
a05-022-07|Service, or over any other aspect of
a05-022-08|defence policy.
a05-025-00|Criticisms about Army manpower appear
a05-025-01|to have come mainly from retired officers
a05-025-02|who have held high positions but
a05-025-03|are out of touch with the existing situation.
a05-025-04|Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
a05-025-05|from the C.I.G.S., Field-Marshal Sir
a05-025-06|Francis Festing, who believes completely
a05-025-07|in the principle of an all-Regular army.
a05-025-08|Gen. Sir Richard Hull, who is to succeed
a05-025-09|Sir Francis, is equally convinced Mr.
a05-025-10|Watkinson is right.
a05-029-00|Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard
a05-029-01|as from Nov. 1. The hand-over, due in
a05-029-02|September, was delayed because of the
a05-029-03|Berlin crisis. Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
a05-029-04|felt the change would be unwise at a
a05-029-05|moment # when attention had to be
a05-029-06|concentrated on possible need for important
a05-029-07|military operations. For this reason Sir
a05-029-08|Francis stayed on, and # sacrificed
a05-029-09|his leave.
a05-039-00|There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing
a05-039-01|towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd,
a05-039-02|the Prime Minister. This implies the dis-
a05-039-03|appearance of the Progressive party from
a05-039-04|the House. Early results in yesterday's
a05-039-05|general election showed Nationalists being
a05-039-06|returned in their strongholds, like Bloem-
a05-039-07|fontein and the Transvaal, with slightly
a05-039-08|increased majorities. In the Cape, the
a05-039-09|veteran United Party politician, Mr. Harry
a05-039-10|Lawrence, standing as a Progressive, was
a05-044-00|The defeat of the leader of the
a05-044-01|Progressive party, Dr. Steytler, in Port
a05-044-02|Elizabeth South, announced immediately
a05-044-03|afterwards by the United party candidate,
a05-044-04|Mr. Plewman, left the Progressives deprived
a05-044-05|of both their chief figures. Dr. Verwoerd and
a05-044-06|the Leader of the Opposition, Sir de
a05-044-07|Villiers Graaff, have been returned unopposed.
a05-044-08|The contests were for 86 seats as 70
a05-044-09|Nationalists and 20 United party candi-
a05-044-10|dates are unopposed.
a05-048-00|Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was
a05-048-01|evident that voters were bored by the
a05-048-02|Government's frequent appeals to the electorate.
a05-048-03|The election was the fourth in four years.
a05-048-04|In most constituencies it may go down as
a05-048-05|the most apathetic in the country's history.
a05-048-06|THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
a05-048-07|last night that he had considered early
a05-048-08|in the Parliamentary recess whether to
a05-048-09|mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
a05-048-10|British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing.
a05-053-00|He decided that it would be a great error
a05-053-01|to do so and to recall Parliament. But
a05-053-02|there would be no hesitation in mobilising
a05-053-03|if a further deterioration in the situation
a05-053-04|warranted such a step. It would have to be
a05-053-05|accompanied by other measures of a military,
a05-053-06|economic and political kind. Mr. Macmillan,
a05-053-07|who was winding up the foreign affairs
a05-053-08|debate, said the Government could not
a05-053-09|be party to accepting as a matter of
a05-053-10|principle the imposed division of Germany.
a05-058-00|" We must not be rattled into surrender,
a05-058-01|but we must not - and I am not - be
a05-058-02|afraid of negotiation." Mr. Godber,
a05-058-03|Minister of State, Foreign Office, said
a05-058-04|earlier that the Government had asked
a05-058-05|the Medical Research Council to reassess
a05-058-06|the fall-out position in view of the Russian
a05-058-07|tests. The Council's findings would be
a05-058-08|made public.
a05-062-00|With a vigour and authority which delighted
a05-062-01|old Parliamentary friends and foes alike,
a05-062-02|the Earl of Avon, the former Sir Anthony
a05-062-03|Eden, in his maiden speech in the House
a05-062-04|of Lords last night, gave a warning
a05-062-05|that # appeasement over Berlin could
a05-062-06|only lead to war. To stand firm, he
a05-062-07|declared, was not to invite war, but
a05-062-08|the surest way to avert it.
a05-069-00|It was the end of a rather curious
a05-069-01|speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
a05-069-02|the two-day debate on foreign affairs.
a05-069-03|He began in a low, almost chatty mono-
a05-069-04|tone, and his voice never rose to any
a05-069-05|accent of urgency. He passed in rapid
a05-069-06|review the United Nations Secretariat;
a05-069-07|nuclear tests; the canard about British
a05-069-08|interference with the United Nations
a05-069-09|in the Congo; Kuwait; and South-East
a05-069-10|Asia.
a05-073-00|He spent most of his short half-hour on
a05-073-01|Berlin. He deplored the possibility of
a05-073-02|some" new myth" about betrayal of Germany
a05-073-03|by the Allies." We do not," he said," really
a05-073-04|know what the Russians want." But he was
a05-073-05|certain that they wanted to establish a
a05-073-06|final and irrevocable division of Germany.
a05-073-07|Britain could not be a party to an imposed
a05-073-08|division. But negotiation, as the debate had
a05-073-09|shown, could be undertaken on a variety
a05-073-10|of bases.
a05-080-00|Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
a05-080-01|ately refrained during the summer from
a05-080-02|recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
a05-080-03|by proclamation, such as would be
a05-080-04|necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
a05-080-05|on to a fully active footing. That
a05-080-06|would have created a thoroughly unde-
a05-080-07|sirable atmosphere of panic. He thought
a05-080-08|that the situation was rather more
a05-080-09|hopeful.
a05-084-00|The Russians now realised its seriousness. The
a05-084-01|French doubts were more about procedure
a05-084-02|than about substance. The Prime Minister's
a05-084-03|attitude of studied calm brought down the
a05-084-04|temperature of the debate, which never
a05-084-05|at any time rose to fever pitch, to a
a05-084-06|remarkable degree of sub-normality.
a05-084-07|Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
a05-084-08|of Home, Foreign Secretary, was listening
a05-084-09|in the Peers' Gallery.
a05-089-00|The early speakers in the debate each
a05-089-01|severely rated the speech of his predecessor.
a05-089-02|These strictures were all too well justified.
a05-089-03|We started with the plaintive wailings
a05-089-04|of Mr. Healey," Shadow" Foreign Secretary,
a05-089-05|described by Mr. Godber, Minister of
a05-089-06|State, Foreign Office, as" pedantic and
a05-089-07|obscure on Berlin, damaging and obscure
a05-089-08|on the Congo." In turn, Mr. Godber was
a05-089-09|censured by Mr. Shinwell, former Labour
a05-089-10|Defence Minister, for having read the
a05-094-00|The trouble about such debates is that
a05-094-01|they range too widely. They remind one of
a05-094-02|the Rugby match in" Tom Brown's Schooldays,"
a05-094-03|in which all the boys were welcome to
a05-094-04|take part, and only those who" really meant
a05-094-05|business" removed their jackets. Not many
a05-094-06|metaphorical braces were visible in the
a05-094-07|early stages of to-night's debate. Mr.
a05-094-08|Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
a05-094-09|golf-course Press conference, which he
a05-094-10|described as" a display of flabby and
a05-099-00|A reference to the reunification of Germany
a05-099-01|brought a bark of" Start another war!"
a05-099-02|from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab., Stoke on Trent S.).
a05-099-03|Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
a05-099-04|theme of limitation of armaments in Europe.
a05-099-05|This could, he suggested, be linked with
a05-099-06|prohibition of the production of atomic
a05-099-07|weapons in any part of Europe. Inspection
a05-099-08|and control would be much easier to
a05-099-09|establish in these territories.
a05-104-00|Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
a05-104-01|using double standards. Ministers had
a05-104-02|rebuked the unaligned nations for not
a05-104-03|condemning the new Russian tests, but
a05-104-04|they themselves had no condemnation for
a05-104-05|events in Angola or Algeria. It was not for
a05-104-06|the Government, said Mr. Healey, to
a05-104-07|take up moral attitudes," especially when
a05-104-08|the temple of their religion is the
a05-104-09|bingo-parlour."
a05-108-00|This puzzled such students of comparative
a05-108-01|religion as had failed to detect this cult.
a05-108-02|But Mr. Healey had a partial and
a05-108-03|limited success. He rallied behind him
a05-108-04|the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last
a05-108-05|night by his leader, Mr. Gaitskell. Mr.
a05-108-06|Godber's performance merited all the mild
a05-108-07|scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell.
a05-113-00|True, he did tell the House that the
a05-113-01|Government had asked the Medical Research
a05-113-02|Council to reassess the fall-out position in
a05-113-03|view of the Russian tests, and said that
a05-113-04|the council's findings would be published.
a05-113-05|He was not so happy in his defence of
a05-113-06|the Government's failure to condemn
a05-113-07|France for her nuclear tests in the
a05-113-08|Sahara on the grounds that they were
a05-113-09|only little ones.
a05-116-00|This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid
a05-116-01|and her illegitimate baby. For the most
a05-116-02|part, Mr. Godber muttered his way
a05-116-03|through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office
a05-116-04|brief. He resembles the elephant seal, an
a05-116-05|# otherwise endearing creature whose
a05-116-06|articulation is limited, we are told, to a
a05-116-07|series of heavy sighs. Sir Lynn Ungoed-
a05-116-08|Thomas, M.P. for Leicester N.E., a former
a05-116-09|Labour Solicitor-General, and Mrs. Barbara
a05-121-00|It was signed by 60 Labour M.P.s, many
a05-121-01|of them Left-wing # sympathisers.
a05-121-02|It condemned" the pollution of the world's
a05-121-03|atmosphere as a crime against humanity."
a05-121-04|A personal letter of protest against the
a05-121-05|tests from Canon Collins, chairman
a05-121-06|of the Campaign for Nuclear
a05-121-07|Disarmament, addressed to Mr.
a05-121-08|# Khruschev, was also taken to the
a05-121-09|Russian Embassy.
a05-125-00|A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT writes: Ban-the-
a05-125-01|bomb demonstrators thronged the Central
a05-125-02|Lobby of the House of Commons last
a05-125-03|night and formed a queue stretching
a05-125-04|for more than 200 yards outside
a05-125-05|in Old Palace Yard. About 2,000
a05-125-06|lobbied M.P.s and harangued them
a05-125-07|on disarmament.
a06-000-00|MR SELWYN LLOYD may speed up his plans
a06-000-01|to catch speculators in shares and property.
a06-000-02|The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to
a06-000-03|public opinion over his" July Budget" came
a06-000-04|dramatically in the Commons yesterday. Mr
a06-000-05|Lloyd said on # Tuesday that he proposed
a06-000-06|to deal in his next regular Budget with
a06-000-07|some profits which now escape tax.
a06-004-00|Sir Edward Boyle, Financial Secretary
a06-004-01|to the Treasury, said yesterday that the
a06-004-02|Government does not like retrospective legislation.
a06-004-03|He went on to describe the kind of
a06-004-04|people the Chancellor hopes to tax. These
a06-004-05|are people buying and selling shares within
a06-004-06|a short period, those" stagging" on a new issue
a06-004-07|and property dealers who form a chain of
a06-004-08|companies and put one property deal through
a06-004-09|each.
a06-008-00|Mr. Harold Wilson, Shadow Chancellor, jumped up to
a06-008-01|offer the Government an easy passage for such
a06-008-02|legislation." Why don't you make proposals to legislate
a06-008-03|in the autumn?" Mr. Wilson asked." We wouldn't call
a06-008-04|it an Autumn Budget. You can call it a Taxation
a06-008-05|Management Bill, if you like." While Mr. Wilson
a06-008-06|was speaking, the Prime Minister and Mr. Lloyd
a06-008-07|had a whispered conversation.
a06-014-00|They nodded at each other and Sir Edward
a06-014-01|rose to say that the Chancellor would bear
a06-014-02|Mr. Wilson's offer in mind. Guy Eden writes:
a06-014-03|Treasury experts are already working on
a06-014-04|the scheme. Profits of genuine investors
a06-014-05|in industry will not be affected, but only
a06-014-06|quick in-and-out speculator deals.
a06-014-07|FRANK FOULKES, Communist president
a06-014-08|of the ETU, refused yesterday to
a06-014-09|" commit suicide" at the TUC's
a06-014-10|invitation.
a06-020-00|He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to the
a06-020-01|ETU. In reply to the call for his resignation he said:" Our rules
a06-020-02|say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to run again
a06-020-03|for three years." I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire,
a06-020-04|so this is an invitation from my good friends of the TUC that
a06-020-05|I should commit hara-kiri.
a06-025-00|The other TUC demands: Five leading
a06-025-01|Communists must not hold office for five
a06-025-02|years; Sub-committees set up to strip
a06-025-03|secretary John Byrne of his powers must
a06-025-04|disband in ten days. These the ETU
a06-025-05|executive rejected as" wholly unacceptable"
a06-025-06|and" unwarranted" interference." But it
a06-025-07|agreed to postpone operation of the sub-
a06-025-08|committees.
a06-036-00|The small rocket craft, for destroying big
a06-036-01|ships, are controlled automatically, even
a06-036-02|to the preparations for launching their
a06-036-03|rockets. Applauding on the river banks at
a06-036-04|Leningrad were thousands now told that in
a06-036-05|20 years they will have free food, housing, light,
a06-036-06|heat, transport and medical treatment - all
a06-036-07|for a working week of 34 to 36 hours.
a06-039-00|" The whole naval might of the Soviet
a06-039-01|Union can be seen here - a truly inspiring
a06-039-02|and proud sight," said Moscow radio's
a06-039-03|commentator. The parade was reviewed by
a06-039-04|Marshal Andrei Grechko, commanding the
a06-039-05|forces of the Warsaw Pact countries -
a06-039-06|the Communist" Nato." He said rocket-
a06-039-07|carrying atomic submarines now formed
a06-039-08|the basis of the Soviet Navy. MR.
a06-039-09|MACMILLAN'S announcement in the
a06-039-10|Commons of his momentous
a06-044-00|Mr. Anthony Fell ( Yarmouth) called the decision" shocking"
a06-044-01|and added:" It is the most disastrous thing any Prime
a06-044-02|Minister has done for many, many generations." He
a06-044-03|concluded:" The best service the Prime Minister can do
a06-044-04|would be to resign." The outburst shocked MPs of
a06-044-05|all parties. Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell
a06-044-06|to stop.
a06-051-00|There were loud cries of" shame" from
a06-051-01|all parts of the Conservative side. Mr.
a06-051-02|Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat
a06-051-03|down. A few minutes later, Mr. Fell got up
a06-051-04|and left the chamber. He returned five
a06-051-05|minutes later to stand just inside the
a06-051-06|doorway looking more composed. In the
a06-051-07|middle of the amazing scene, Mr. Macmillan
a06-051-08|waved his hand at Mr. Fell.
a06-057-00|This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more." I cannot be told
a06-057-01|to sit down by the Prime Minister." Protests had been expected
a06-057-02|from Tory rebels. But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented. He
a06-057-03|accused the Prime Minister of" political double talk."" It had
a06-057-04|the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
a06-057-05|Minister is a national disaster," he said.
a06-064-00|Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had, if
a06-064-01|anything, rallied support to the Prime Minister.
a06-064-02|This apparently, was Mr. Macmillan's assessment.
a06-064-03|He confined his reply to the observation
a06-064-04|that Mr. Fell had probably" maximised his
a06-064-05|support." There were no other attacks
a06-064-06|of such ferocity. But there was ample
a06-064-07|evidence of Conservative and Labour
a06-064-08|opposition, which will be aired in the
a06-064-09|debate tomorrow and on Thursday.
a06-070-00|As Mr. Macmillan made his announcement, the
a06-070-01|House was crowded. He said:" No # British
a06-070-02|Government could join the European Economic
a06-070-03|Community without prior negotiation with a view
a06-070-04|to meeting the needs of the Commonwealth countries,
a06-070-05|of our European Free Trade Association partners
a06-070-06|and of British agriculture." Near the end of a
a06-070-07|long statement, Mr. Macmillan stated the
a06-070-08|Government's intention:
a06-075-00|" After long and earnest consideration, Her
a06-075-01|Majesty's Government have come to the
a06-075-02|conclusion that it would be right for
a06-075-03|Britain to make a formal application..
a06-075-04|for negotiations with a view to joining
a06-075-05|the Community." At this point, Mr. Paul
a06-075-06|Williams ( Cons., Sunderland) called out
a06-075-07|" Shame." Mr. Williams is a close
a06-075-08|associate of Mr. Fell.
a06-090-00|He claimed that, unless we were in the
a06-090-01|Common Market, we should not be able to
a06-090-02|play any part in # determining its future.
a06-090-03|" We can lead better from within," he said.
a06-090-04|Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection
a06-090-05|raised by Tory critics. Mr. Anthony Fell,
a06-090-06|who created a scene on this point on
a06-090-07|Monday, took up a position almost hidden
a06-090-08|behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair.
a06-095-00|Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help
a06-095-01|to the Commonwealth through the
a06-095-02|strength we would gain in the Common
a06-095-03|Market than by isolation. He paid
a06-095-04|tribute to the development of the
a06-095-05|Common Market." The Community
a06-095-06|( Common Market) has imparted an
a06-095-07|impetus and an economic growth
a06-095-08|to The Six. Above all, it is an idea
a06-095-09|which has gripped men's minds,"
a06-095-10|he said.
a06-100-00|Referring to previous negotiations, Mr. Macmillan looked towards
a06-100-01|Mr. Reginald Maudling." These were negotiations in which the
a06-100-02|President of the Board of Trade played a conspicuous part," the
a06-100-03|Premier said. He dismissed the idea that Britain would be
a06-100-04|swamped by cheap labour. Our industry, he said, would
a06-100-05|probably gain." Many people feel we have had, perhaps, too
a06-100-06|much shelter," he went on.
a06-110-00|Conservatives protested when
a06-110-01|Mr. Gaitskell said he had been
a06-110-02|told this" by some # people
a06-110-03|of considerable authority," he
a06-110-04|retorted." I agree with the Prime
a06-110-05|Minister that I do not think
a06-110-06|we are necessarily bound for
a06-110-07|federalism in Europe," he went
a06-110-08|on.
a06-114-00|If we joined the Common Market, our
a06-114-01|food subsidies would probably be
a06-114-02|replaced by a system of tariffs" That
a06-114-03|will mean a rise in the cost of living."
a06-114-04|BUDGETTE or no Budgette YOU are
a06-114-05|spending more as the summer holiday
a06-114-06|season moves into top gear.
a06-114-07|On the eve of August Bank Holiday
a06-114-08|the spending spree is at a new
a06-114-09|all-time peak.
a06-119-00|Note circulation soared for the
a06-119-01|sixth successive week - this
a06-119-02|time by more than 15,000,000 # last
a06-119-03|week. And that brought the figure
a06-119-04|to a record 2,415,000,000. This was
a06-119-05|100,000,000 more than the corresponding
a06-119-06|week last year and 37,000,000 up on
a06-119-07|the 1960 record set last Christmas.
a06-119-08|Now look at the other side of all
a06-119-09|these coins.
a06-124-00|The big" squeeze" means that it is going to be more
a06-124-01|difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft. And banks will be
a06-124-02|stricter in recalling existing overdrafts. This is underlined in
a06-124-03|the Central Bank's weekly return...... which shows that more
a06-124-04|than 163,000,000 of the banks' money is now frozen in the
a06-124-05|form of special deposits with the Bank of England.
a06-128-00|Banks have paid in a first
a06-128-01|instalment of almost 8,000,000
a06-128-02|in response to the Budgette appeal.
a06-128-03|About another 70,000,000 is due
a06-128-04|by September 20. For nearly a year
a06-128-05|about 150,000,000 has been frozen.
a06-128-06|MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of
a06-128-07|German militarism in his replies to
a06-128-08|the West on Berlin. And he repeats
a06-128-09|that the problem" must be solved
a06-128-10|this year."
a06-134-00|The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to
a06-134-01|West Germany were published in Moscow yesterday. They
a06-134-02|tell: The U.S. - It is false to say the absence of a peace
a06-134-03|treaty with Germany causes no real danger. West Germany,
a06-134-04|with its militarists and revenge-seekers, is becoming a
a06-134-05|hotbed of war danger in Europe. Even now, aided by
a06-134-06|the U.S., Britain and France, it has more than enough
a06-134-07|forces and arms to touch off a world war.
a06-141-00|BRITAIN - One cannot but wonder at British bases being
a06-141-01|put at the disposal of those very militarists who razed
a06-141-02|Coventry and barbarously bombed London and other British
a06-141-03|cities. FRANCE - One can hardly conceive the French are
a06-141-04|not alarmed.... Next door, in West Germany, before everyone's
a06-141-05|eyes there has sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi
a06-141-06|generals and officers.
a06-147-00|With fire and sword France denies Algeria the right to self-
a06-147-01|determination and tramples on Tunisians' right to independence.
a06-147-02|WEST GERMANY - Russia would like to see a clear #
a06-147-03|realization that West Germany would not survive even a few hours
a06-147-04|of a third world war. The best way to rule out such a tragic
a06-147-05|contingency would be to sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous
a06-147-06|growth of West Berlin's occupation status.
a06-152-00|Behind Bonn's slogan of German self-
a06-152-01|determination is the intention to impose
a06-152-02|on East Germany the regime existing in
a06-152-03|West Germany. REFUGEES are pouring out
a06-152-04|# of East Germany into West
a06-152-05|Berlin faster than ever. Mr. K's latest
a06-152-06|speech scared 1,157 East Germans to
a06-152-07|cross into West Berlin's reception centre
a06-152-08|DURING MONDAY NIGHT. And officials
a06-152-09|expect the total to leap to
a06-152-10|3,000 a day.
a06-157-00|This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the
a06-157-01|East German disturbances on July 17, 1953. And officials
a06-157-02|fear it may be too much for the city's refugee camps.
a06-157-03|They will overflow and private houses will have to be used.
b01-000-00|Prime Minister after Prime Minister speaks out
b01-000-01|in revulsion against the South African
b01-000-02|Government's policy of apartheid as we wait
b01-000-03|for the curtain to rise on the Commonwealth
b01-000-04|Conference in London. Will it end with
b01-000-05|South Africa's exclusion from the
b01-000-06|Commonwealth? The issue is touch and go.
b01-004-00|There is a possibility that it will not be
b01-004-01|settled at this conference. It may be agreed to
b01-004-02|wait until South Africa actually becomes a
b01-004-03|Republic later in the year. But if a final
b01-004-04|decision is to be faced now, on which side
b01-004-05|do the strongest arguments lie? THE Archbishop
b01-004-06|of Capetown has shown that the matter is
b01-004-07|not clear-cut.
b01-009-00|The Archbishop has long been a courageous
b01-009-01|fighter against apartheid. He must be heard
b01-009-02|with attention. On purely practical grounds he
b01-009-03|holds that it would be a mistake to expel
b01-009-04|South Africa, weakening the whites who are
b01-009-05|working for a change of policy. In his view
b01-009-06|it would also be against the interests of the
b01-009-07|Africans.
b01-014-00|He holds that more pressure can be put on South
b01-014-01|Africa while she remains in the Commonwealth
b01-014-02|than could be exercised were she cut off from it.
b01-014-03|On the other hand, those who favour expulsion, inclu-
b01-014-04|ding African leaders, feel that nothing less than the
b01-014-05|shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr.
b01-014-06|Verwoerd and the Nationalists. They point out
b01-014-07|that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning
b01-014-08|the apartheid policy.
b01-018-00|THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society. A
b01-018-01|policy of racial discrimination in any of its countries
b01-018-02|is surely the one thing that it could not survive.
b01-018-03|Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in
b01-018-04|London, millions at home would regard as fraudulent
b01-018-05|a Commonwealth which had room for a racist
b01-018-06|South Africa. And this is a Commonwealth in
b01-018-07|which five citizens are coloured for every one
b01-018-08|who is white.
b01-023-00|Seen in this wider picture, a South Africa that clings to
b01-023-01|apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a
b01-023-02|liability to the whole Western world. A practical
b01-023-03|solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft
b01-023-04|a set of principles excluding race discrimination.
b01-023-05|And so leave South Africa to make the grade,
b01-023-06|or go out.
b01-027-00|THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home
b01-027-01|tonight from their tour in the East. The duke's
b01-027-02|trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts
b01-027-03|have taken the headlines in this country.
b01-027-04|Nevertheless, the tour has been an immense
b01-027-05|success. The Queen has won a triumph. It
b01-027-06|would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal
b01-027-07|performances as tiger and rhino hunts were
b01-027-08|dropped from future Royal programmes.
b01-033-00|But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by
b01-033-01|their visit. The warmth of their welcome in India and
b01-033-02|Pakistan are happy memories. WEST GERMANY - followed
b01-033-03|yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture
b01-033-04|of a good neighbour. She has put up the value
b01-033-05|of her money.
b01-038-00|Certainly, the rise is very small. But it is a step
b01-038-01|in the direction of live-and-let-live. Hopes
b01-038-02|will now grow brighter of further international
b01-038-03|co-operation, which is the only way to solve the
b01-038-04|payments difficulties that upset the Western world.
b01-038-05|Britain and the U.S., which have problems with
b01-038-06|their balances, will gain some immediate help.
b01-038-07|What it means in practical terms is that our
b01-038-08|exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
b01-038-09|for Germans to buy, while the goods which
b01-038-10|Germany exports will be made a little dearer.
b01-044-00|Booming Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports
b01-044-01|as a means to curb rising prices at home. She is
b01-044-02|also aware how # unpopular she has been growing
b01-044-03|by failing until now to co-operate as a creditor nation
b01-044-04|should. Germany exports much more than she imports.
b01-044-05|For upwards of five years the world's reserves of
b01-044-06|dollars have been drained into Germany.
b01-049-00|There they have stayed uselessly locked up because
b01-049-01|Germany has no tradition of trading abroad. In addition
b01-049-02|the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted
b01-049-03|speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars,
b01-049-04|hoping for the mark to rise, as has now happened.
b01-049-05|WILL the new valuation be enough to correct
b01-049-06|Germany's massive trading surplus and choke
b01-049-07|off speculation against dollar and pound?
b01-053-00|That is doubtful. If however, in addition to her new
b01-053-01|good-neighbour gesture, Germany takes a really big
b01-053-02|share in giving aid to underdeveloped nations, the
b01-053-03|world outlook will be brighter. What gives rise
b01-053-04|to optimism is the sign that Germany and the
b01-053-05|other leading Western nations are at long last
b01-053-06|moving towards a solution of currency problems
b01-053-07|by co-operation.
b01-057-00|A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine, paid
b01-057-01|for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament.
b01-057-02|Those who lend their names to this kind of
b01-057-03|advertisement are worthy people, a little innocent
b01-057-04|of politics, perhaps, or carried away by the
b01-057-05|idea that moral regeneration would solve
b01-057-06|all our problems. So it would. While we are
b01-057-07|waiting for the millenium, however, most of us
b01-057-08|would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in
b01-057-09|instruments of democracy, such as trade unions
b01-057-10|and our local and national Parliaments.
b01-062-00|Should the Herald publish such advertisements?
b01-062-01|This is a difficult question. It would obviously
b01-062-02|be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
b01-062-03|which we disagree. When an advertisement
b01-062-04|contains statements whose factual truth is
b01-062-05|doubtful, or where the total content would be
b01-062-06|deeply repugnant to our readers, it is right to
b01-062-07|exercise editorial discretion. The MRA
b01-062-08|advertisement falls into neither category, though
b01-062-09|many readers will dislike it.
b01-073-00|The first reaction of the Sudanese
b01-073-01|Government was to denounce the United
b01-073-02|Nations for" negligence and impotence," and
b01-073-03|to say that its 400 troops in the Congo
b01-073-04|would be taken home. The reaction can be
b01-073-05|understood. The Sudan's concern for its
b01-073-06|men is natural. But this could hardly be
b01-073-07|a # dignified exit. IF the UN is
b01-073-08|blamed for being weak, it would be
b01-073-09|more logical to send in more men,
b01-073-10|not weaken it further by desertion.
b01-079-00|It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
b01-079-01|Hammarskjold and the UN's servants. The
b01-079-02|responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
b01-079-03|which have undertaken the task of pre-
b01-079-04|serving peace in the Congo. That is not a
b01-079-05|ceremonial duty, and the soldiers have every
b01-079-06|right to blame the politicians unless they see
b01-079-07|it through. When the United Nations instructed
b01-079-08|Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
b01-079-09|prevent civil war, it was clear that new dangers
b01-079-10|would arise unless it gave him the political...
b01-084-00|That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold
b01-084-01|made. India has responded handsomely by providing
b01-084-02|3,000 men, who must take about a fortnight to arrive.
b01-084-03|If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground,
b01-084-04|such incidents as that at Matadi would not
b01-084-05|happen. THE UN's ability to keep peace depends
b01-084-06|simply on adequate support by the nations
b01-084-07|which have set their hands to this plough.
b01-089-00|The big Powers involved in the Cold War
b01-089-01|must of course keep out. The Americans were
b01-089-02|justified in diverting naval ships in case
b01-089-03|non-combatant help was wanted; but they
b01-089-04|stressed that there was no intention to intervene
b01-089-05|in fighting. Yesterday the ships turned away
b01-089-06|again, satisfied that they were not required.
b01-089-07|It is to be hoped that the UN will be
b01-089-08|re-established in their port by negotiation
b01-089-09|and that there will be no more outrages.
b01-094-00|But back, Mr. Hammarskjold is determined,
b01-094-01|they must go. The best news for the Congo
b01-094-02|would be agreement between its rival
b01-094-03|political leaders. Through the patient efforts
b01-094-04|of UN conciliators they are meeting for
b01-094-05|the first time, in Malagasy ( formerly
b01-094-06|Madagascar). THE world will sigh with
b01-094-07|relief when this strife-torn land gets
b01-094-08|itself a government which all outsiders
b01-094-09|can recognise.
b01-113-00|ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards
b01-113-01|as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as" a
b01-113-02|policy of good neighbourliness." We may be sure that
b01-113-03|he is not being hypocritical. That is what he
b01-113-04|really believes. A good neighbour to those Africans
b01-113-05|who, under apartheid, will be forced back to
b01-113-06|their tribal reserves with no prospect but a
b01-113-07|cramped and primitive existence.
b01-118-00|A good neighbour to those Africans who will con-
b01-118-01|tinue to live as hewers of wood and drawers of
b01-118-02|water in the white areas of South Africa, without rights
b01-118-03|and without hope. THE same sort of good neighbour
b01-118-04|that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
b01-118-05|Hitler in the thirties. It was Dr. Verwoerd who
b01-118-06|led a protest against admitting any of them
b01-118-07|because they would" defile" the national
b01-118-08|white stock.
b01-122-00|It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
b01-122-01|woerd in his nightmare world. It is this that
b01-122-02|makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
b01-122-03|fluenced to change course. The Archbishop of
b01-122-04|Capetown, Dr. Joost de Blank, has pleaded that
b01-122-05|South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
b01-122-06|Commonwealth. Otherwise, he says, those inside the
b01-122-07|country who still oppose apartheid will be
b01-122-08|left even more isolated and alone.
b01-127-00|The views of the Archbishop, who has
b01-127-01|maintained an unflinching witness to what
b01-127-02|Christianity really means, must carry weight. But
b01-127-03|what, in fact, can the other Commonwealth countries
b01-127-04|do to bring support and comfort to this gallant
b01-127-05|minority? THERE is no evidence that the
b01-127-06|policy of appeasement has modified the
b01-127-07|actions of the Nationalists. On the contrary,
b01-127-08|apartheid is being applied ever more
b01-127-09|ruthlessly.
b01-132-00|The shock of expulsion from the
b01-132-01|Commonwealth now seems to be the only
b01-132-02|way left to try to bring home to the people of
b01-132-03|South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them
b01-132-04|to disaster. It may be that the Commonwealth
b01-132-05|Prime Ministers will decide against this final
b01-132-06|step. If that is their decision they should also
b01-132-07|go unequivocally on record that they regard
b01-132-08|apartheid as evil and indefensible.
b01-136-00|Unless they do at least that, Dr. Verwoerd will
b01-136-01|be able to return home claiming a triumph.
b01-136-02|His smile will be blander than ever. WE are in
b01-136-03|for it again: another Royal Wedding. Between
b01-136-04|now and June, when the Duke of Kent will
b01-136-05|marry Miss Worsley, hardly a day will pass
b01-136-06|without a story or a picture or probably both,
b01-136-07|about the nuptial arrangements.
b02-013-00|What seems certain is that those who
b02-013-01|advocate putting off any approach until
b02-013-02|Mr Krushchev gives evidence of a change
b02-013-03|of heart ( whatever that may mean) would
b02-013-04|have us run risks greater than the West
b02-013-05|ought to run - and greater than President
b02-013-06|Kennedy's most influential advisers seem
b02-013-07|disposed to face. The real question is
b02-013-08|what we should put to the Soviet
b02-013-09|Government as a basis for talks: and
b02-035-00|On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls
b02-035-01|manoeuvring, and what we should call
b02-035-02|cool-headed and inventive negotiation, is
b02-035-03|a means not to destruction but to safety.
b02-035-04|The Government's pompous little statement
b02-035-05|on Northern Rhodesia does not say much,
b02-035-06|but it says what is necessary - that
b02-035-07|the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
b02-035-08|open to revision. This is news, however
b02-035-09|much the Government tries to disguise
b02-035-10|it by saying that the revision would be
b02-045-00|Formula One, which appeared in February, appeared to make
b02-045-01|this likely; Formula Two, which appeared in June, made it
b02-045-02|very unlikely; if Formula Three restores the original
b02-045-03|principle, that is all that need be required of it. It is a pity
b02-045-04|that the Government should ever have been led away
b02-045-05|from this principle. It is a great pity that the
b02-045-06|Government should give the appearance of responding, not
b02-045-07|to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations, but to
b02-045-08|the violence which he tried to prevent.
b02-097-00|To be able to say" New York next week" is an
b02-097-01|important advance. We must not be overconfident
b02-097-02|that this # meeting will lead on to further
b02-097-03|and decisive ones; but without it, we could not
b02-097-04|look for them. Federal Germany votes tomorrow
b02-097-05|and not a day too soon. There can seldom have
b02-097-06|been an election campaign which more people
b02-097-07|in and out of the country wanted to see over
b02-097-08|and done with.
b02-102-00|To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a
b02-102-01|millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their
b02-102-02|efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with
b02-102-03|the Berlin crisis. It need not have been such a burden
b02-102-04|if Western Governments had not been convinced
b02-102-05|that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr
b02-102-06|Adenauer's chances of being returned as Chancellor.
b02-105-00|But they were so convinced and they
b02-105-01|have had to take the consequences. Mean-
b02-105-02|while in Germany itself the course of
b02-105-03|the campaign has dismayed a good
b02-105-04|many people: they too will be glad
b02-105-05|when the polling stations close.
b03-025-00|But discussion on current points of east-west con-
b03-025-01|flict could not go much farther than, for example, the
b03-025-02|truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
b03-025-03|cannot be followed together. What the council has done -
b03-025-04|and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-
b03-025-05|tact across the greatest political barrier in what
b03-025-06|is not yet a unitary world.
b03-087-00|The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
b03-087-01|agreement is signed. To this there will be some opposition. The Bill is
b03-087-02|short and modest in scope, and it is doubtful whether the other Private
b03-087-03|Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps. This fact may give
b03-087-04|the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the
b03-087-05|next report from the Molony committee.
b03-092-00|Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable. They should not,
b03-092-01|however, disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of
b03-092-02|parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run.
b03-092-03|Centigrade v. Fahrenheit. The fight is on. The challenger has behind
b03-092-04|it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR
b03-092-05|but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro-
b03-092-06|logical Office.
b03-098-00|The press and the broadcasting authorities are
b03-098-01|asked to help. To begin with, both tempe-
b03-098-02|ratures will be put in the ring together.
b03-098-03|SIR GRAHAM SUTTON, however, made no bones
b03-098-04|about it yesterday. The purpose is to give
b03-098-05|fahrenheit the knock out. The backers of
b03-098-06|centigrade would have got off to a better
b03-098-07|start if they had taken more pains to
b03-098-08|explain the advantages to the general
b03-098-09|public of the change.
b03-104-00|It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is
b03-104-01|at the moment" an awful mess up" in
b03-104-02|the measurement of temperatures. This,
b03-104-03|however, seems a matter of the convenience
b03-104-04|of specialists. The ordinary British man
b03-104-05|and woman is conscious of no difficulty.
b03-104-06|Rather than fifty million people having
b03-104-07|to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there
b03-104-08|any reason why the centigrade countries
b03-104-09|should not change to fahrenheit?
b03-109-00|Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-
b03-109-01|strably better than the other? The centigraders may
b03-109-02|be in for a stiffer fight than they think. They may
b03-109-03|have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market.
b03-109-04|Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
b03-109-05|public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
b03-109-06|circumstances the time would come when this would
b03-109-07|suit their convenience - rather than to change their
b03-109-08|system of recording temperatures.
b03-114-00|In any case, fahrenheit need not lose heart.
b03-114-01|Once before, and that not so long ago, the
b03-114-02|authorities ganged up to alter the habits
b03-114-03|of the people. That effort was to enforce
b03-114-04|the adoption of the twenty-four hour
b03-114-05|clock. Then, also, the B.B.C. were
b03-114-06|roped in. The only result was
b03-114-07|that the well-meaning corporation
b03-114-08|became very unpopular.
b04-000-00|A BAFFLED and bewildered little country
b04-000-01|stands at the centre of an international
b04-000-02|storm. Belgium is accused - without a
b04-000-03|scrap of evidence - of being implicated in
b04-000-04|the murder of Patrice Lumumba. Her
b04-000-05|leaders are insulted, her embassies are
b04-000-06|attacked in a score of countries.
b04-004-00|In Ghana, President Nkrumah, who
b04-004-01|has done more than most to stir up
b04-004-02|trouble in the Congo, orders every Belgian
b04-004-03|citizen to quit his country. HOUNDING
b04-004-04|Belgium has become an international
b04-004-05|pastime. Why? Because those who
b04-004-06|said the Congolese could govern themselves
b04-004-07|will not admit they were wrong. So
b04-004-08|Belgium, bowed down by internal
b04-004-09|troubles, mourning a terrible air crash,
b04-004-10|is made their scapegoat.
b04-010-00|Who will speak for Belgium? Who else but
b04-010-01|Britain. We have fought beside Belgium
b04-010-02|in two world wars. We are allies still.
b04-010-03|Britain should champion Belgium. Not
b04-010-04|with the careful, hooded language of diplomacy,
b04-010-05|but boldly and fearlessly. It is time to
b04-010-06|show the world that this country does not
b04-010-07|desert her friends. HAPPY, happy
b04-010-08|families! Never before have Britain's
b04-010-09|larders been so well stocked.
b04-020-00|Supplies of meat and dairy produce were
b04-020-01|substantially higher last year than in 1959.
b04-020-02|Lucky, lucky housewives! To have such a
b04-020-03|splendid variety of goods to choose from.
b04-020-04|Not so long ago older folk were reminding
b04-020-05|young wives, # harassed by
b04-020-06|shortages, of the good old days of
b04-020-07|abundance. Now it is mother who
b04-020-08|picks up recipes from # her daughter.
b04-026-00|The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in
b04-026-01|Britain today!" THIS is colour day," proclaimed the American
b04-026-02|television network, N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its
b04-026-03|programmes in bright colours. In America colour TV is five years
b04-026-04|old. There are already 600,000 sets in use. What about Britain?
b04-026-05|The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service, but the
b04-026-06|commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years.
b04-034-00|The Government should settle this argument with two words to
b04-034-01|the B.B.C.: - Go ahead! ONE man beyond all others is saddened
b04-034-02|by the deaths of two elderly sisters who killed themselves because
b04-034-03|they had to leave their cottage. Mr. John Crabb, clerk to
b04-034-04|Newmarket urban council, says:" I shall always feel this as a
b04-034-05|personal failure."
b04-040-00|There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself. The
b04-040-01|sisters had to quit as their home was falling down. And Mr. Crabb
b04-040-02|did his best for them, even driving them to a new house. John
b04-040-03|Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding. Too
b04-040-04|often lacking in officialdom. MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton
b04-040-05|does not want his daughter to marry a Scotsman.
b04-047-00|He says that the Scots are foreigners who have no business to
b04-047-01|be in England. The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a
b04-047-02|Scot. The Lord Chancellor is a Scot. The Prime Minister is a
b04-047-03|Scot - and so were four of his predecessors this # century.
b04-047-04|Let Mr. Newton beware. By protesting against Scotland he
b04-047-05|may be guilty of rebellion!
b04-054-00|ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial.
b04-054-01|His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for
b04-054-02|five years. During this period Britain will be expected
b04-054-03|to subsidise and defend the Cypriots. They will enjoy
b04-054-04|all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference. It is a
b04-054-05|safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
b04-054-06|company will sign on again.
b04-060-00|It is equally certain that the British Government
b04-060-01|will welcome them. How splendid it would be if, just
b04-060-02|for once, the Government were to voice the real feelings of
b04-060-03|the British people. And tell Makarios they are not
b04-060-04|prepared to accept him on such terms. GOOD cheer
b04-060-05|for the week-end. Ford Motors are to put 13,000
b04-060-06|men back on a five-day week.
b04-066-00|One more demonstration of the industry's recovery. As
b04-066-01|springtime approaches, orders pick up. And the car men get
b04-066-02|ready for another bustling season. The pessimists
b04-066-03|said the motor industry was on its knees. The optimists
b04-066-04|said" Nonsense." As usual, the optimists have been
b04-066-05|proved right. EARL RUSSELL and his friends have
b04-066-06|hit on an original way of spending this afternoon.
b04-075-00|They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence. It is
b04-075-01|their protest against the H-bomb. They ought to have a
b04-075-02|pleasant time. The weather forecast is good; except for them,
b04-075-03|Whitehall should be deserted. And they will have a fine view
b04-075-04|of St. James's Park, with its placid lake, pelicans,
b04-075-05|rare ducks, and other wild life.
b04-081-00|Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today?
b04-081-01|Head for the parks to enjoy the sun. Not in
b04-081-02|a foolish cause, but in a glorious one. Good health!
b04-081-03|THIS group of men, says a report, work on average
b04-081-04|between 55 and 60 hours a week. They also put
b04-081-05|in an extra two or three evenings. And they never
b04-081-06|go on strike.
b04-089-00|Who are they? The trade union officials of Britain.
b04-089-01|Men who earn only a fraction of what their
b04-089-02|talents and responsibilities could bring in the open
b04-089-03|labour market. The unions are fortunate indeed to
b04-089-04|find dedicated leaders at cut-rate prices. But it is
b04-089-05|time the members decided to pay up and be good
b04-089-06|employers. THE Labour Party says that the Tory
b04-089-07|Government is destroying the social services.
b04-096-00|Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
b04-096-01|national income was spent on social services. The
b04-096-02|present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
b04-096-03|worthwhile targets for the Opposition. What a pity
b04-096-04|to aim at the wrong one! MRS. MARCIA POWER,
b04-096-05|whose husband made her clean his uniform, wins
b04-096-06|a divorce. The judge says she had to act almost
b04-096-07|as a serf.
b04-103-00|Up and down the country husbands will be saying
b04-103-01|they would never behave like that. But do they ever
b04-103-02|ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously
b04-103-03|returned to the shed; their books tidied; and often,
b04-103-04|even their shoes cleaned? How wonderful if they
b04-103-05|showed their appreciation this morning with a surprise
b04-103-06|box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers!
b04-107-00|HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly
b04-107-01|in Rhodesia! Eighteen months ago this territory
b04-107-02|was peaceful, orderly, and thriving. Africans within the
b04-107-03|Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
b04-107-04|administration. Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
b04-107-05|Secretary. Suddenly everything changed. Timetables were
b04-107-06|scrapped. The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
b04-107-07|rushed out to Rhodesia. Overnight, minor African
b04-107-08|politicians were inflated into international figures.
b04-116-00|And as the British Government stepped up the pace
b04-116-01|of change, so the Africans stepped up their demands.
b04-116-02|TODAY, in London, that rash and thoughtless policy has
b04-116-03|caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened.
b04-116-04|No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching.
b04-116-05|If the Government now reverses its plan to give the
b04-116-06|Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face
b04-116-07|difficulties from African politicians greedy for power.
b04-121-00|But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
b04-121-01|be plunged into chaos, like the Congo. For Mr.
b04-121-02|Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice. They
b04-121-03|must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos. And try to
b04-121-04|repair the damage they have done. WHO can grow the
b04-121-05|fastest? That is the exciting competition going on
b04-121-06|among Britain's major industries.
b04-128-00|Top of the table, at the moment, is the chemical industry.
b04-128-01|Then comes engineering, followed by iron and steel.
b04-128-02|Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
b04-128-03|tremendous upsurge in investment. It reports that new
b04-128-04|factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
b04-128-05|up on 1960. Britain's business men are right to back
b04-128-06|their faith with cash.
b04-134-00|For expansion today means still greater
b04-134-01|prosperity tomorrow. BERTRAND RUSSELL,
b04-134-02|the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
b04-134-03|the-Bomb crusade, has devoted following.
b04-134-04|Thousands march with him - and sit with him
b04-134-05|too. It is said by some that he is a saint; by
b04-134-06|others that he is a prophet. He is, in fact, a
b04-134-07|philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
b04-134-08|who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
b04-134-09|issues of our time.
b04-140-00|BEFORE the war he urged the British people
b04-140-01|to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists.
b04-140-02|After the war he favoured a preventive war against
b04-140-03|Russia. Now he wants Britain to demolish her
b04-140-04|defences. Throughout the years Lord Russell
b04-140-05|and his supporters have been able to pursue their
b04-140-06|eccentric campaigns in freedom. They should
b04-140-07|ask themselves this question: How long would
b04-140-08|that freedom last if their policies were adopted?
b04-147-00|AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity
b04-147-01|Board. The board is laying a cable along a seven-
b04-147-02|mile route in Surrey. A warden, Mr. Jack Finlay,
b04-147-03|has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for
b04-147-04|householders when trenches are dug outside their
b04-147-05|front gates. Splendid. By showing concern
b04-147-06|for the people the board will earn their good will.
b04-147-07|Happy patrolling, Mr. Finlay!
b04-154-00|GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky! The tough,
b04-154-01|resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation
b04-154-02|shakes the life out of his critics. He calls them
b04-154-03|" jelly-boned." He promises to preserve federation
b04-154-04|against African fanatics and woolly minded
b04-154-05|individuals in the West. Some may ask: Is
b04-154-06|Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who
b04-154-07|disagree with him? The facts answer that.
b04-162-00|CONTRAST his firm, successful rule in Rhodesia
b04-162-01|with what has happened in the Congo. There
b04-162-02|Welensky's opponents have carried their theories
b04-162-03|into practice. There a UNO army of Africans,
b04-162-04|bossed by an Indian, has been in charge for
b04-162-05|months. And what has it made of the Congo?
b04-162-06|A bloodstained shambles. No wonder
b04-162-07|Welensky has lost all patience with his
b04-162-08|misguided tormentors.
b04-169-00|They have earned his strictures. And his
b04-169-01|contempt. SOME people are for ever complaining
b04-169-02|that teenagers earn too much and spend it all
b04-169-03|when they get it. Now a survey of the Post
b04-169-04|Office Savings Bank shows how wrong that
b04-169-05|idea is. The biggest group of depositors in
b04-169-06|the bank is made of boys and girls aged 15
b04-169-07|to 19.
b04-175-00|Certainly teenagers earn more than ever before.
b04-175-01|Certainly they spend more. But how splendid
b04-175-02|that in the most prosperous days in this
b04-175-03|country's history the old-fashioned virtue of thrift
b04-175-04|should still have a powerful appeal for young
b04-175-05|people. THE Danes are annoyed with British
b04-175-06|farmers for fighting against Danish competition.
b04-175-07|They say that our farmers do not seem to
b04-175-08|understand the meaning of free trade.
b04-181-00|There is no doubt what the Danes understand
b04-181-01|by free trade. It is that they should be free
b04-181-02|to sell as much as they like, while buying
b04-181-03|more and more from our rivals. Germany has
b04-181-04|now supplanted Britain as Denmark's
b04-181-05|principal supplier. The farmers of Britain
b04-181-06|understand free trade. That is why they fight
b04-181-07|it.
b04-187-00|THE Palace cinema at Buckley, near Chester, will be
b04-187-01|reopened next week by Barry Flanagan and Eric
b04-187-02|Platt, both aged 19. Eric says:" We believe in the
b04-187-03|cinema. And we know what people want." The
b04-187-04|combination of enthusiasm and shrewd anticipation
b04-187-05|of public taste has launched many great
b04-187-06|enterprises. Barry and Eric have enthusiasm. They
b04-187-07|are backed by a resurgent film industry.
b04-195-00|It could be curtain up on two success stories. Of
b04-195-01|the old Palace. And Barry and Eric. DONS at
b04-195-02|Cambridge want the study of agriculture to become
b04-195-03|an honours degree course. Farming is Britain's
b04-195-04|most vital industry. It is increasingly dependent
b04-195-05|on new techniques - and on the universities to
b04-195-06|provide men of knowledge and skill.
b04-202-00|The older universities are often accused of being
b04-202-01|interested only in dead subjects. Now Cambridge has
b04-202-02|the opportunity to show is just as interested in the
b04-202-03|living. Particularly as its rival, Oxford, has had a
b04-202-04|similar course in farming for 15 years!
b04-202-05|JOHN GLENN, Virgil Grissom, Alan Shepard. One of
b04-202-06|these three men has a date with destiny - the
b04-202-07|first journey into Space.
b04-208-00|At the beginning of this wonderful century many
b04-208-01|people believed that there were no more worlds to
b04-208-02|conquer.
b05-017-00|Nobody 's going to shove 2ole Uncle Sam around!" He then
b05-017-01|took out a piece of paper, wrote his address on it and added:
b05-017-02|" Anybody mucking the Yanks about had better call on me
b05-017-03|first. I won't stand for it." Exit a puzzled American.
b05-017-04|The other incident occurred in the boat-train from Cherbourg
b05-017-05|to Paris.
b05-032-00|The travellers from the New World who had
b05-032-01|been in Britain many times before, were
b05-032-02|slightly stunned. Afterwards they said:" We thought
b05-032-03|we knew it all, but you Britishers never run
b05-032-04|out of unturned stones."
b05-032-05|To the British Travel Association, doing their excellent
b05-032-06|darndest, I offer these sad complexities. IN the 1830's
b05-032-07|the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and
b05-032-08|many a good trade unionist since then has, in the
b05-032-09|hope of improving the lot of his fellow workers, taken
b05-032-10|the theoretical Luddite hammer again.
b05-038-00|Hence the hostility to automation and
b05-038-01|the stop-watch manufacturing methods that
b05-038-02|have # led to restrictive practices. Now a new
b05-038-03|threat to those who toil and spin has been
b05-038-04|developed by a firm specialising in electronics
b05-038-05|in Los Angeles. They have developed a new
b05-038-06|system whereby completely untrained workers
b05-038-07|can be taught their trade by means of tape
b05-038-08|recordings and television.
b05-042-00|What happens is that the unskilled worker
b05-042-01|is processed, by high-speed listening to recorded
b05-042-02|instructions on how to do the job coupled with
b05-042-03|explanatory TV pictures, into becoming a highly
b05-042-04|skilled, obedient craftsman in no time at all.
b05-042-05|Not only can the raw human mind be
b05-042-06|technically equipped very quickly to do one
b05-042-07|set of skilled manufacturing processes in one
b05-042-08|trade but, by being given another of the new
b05-042-09|audio-TV training techniques, he can be switched
b05-042-10|to a different industry if he just gives in and
b05-045-00|From being an assembler in an aircraft
b05-045-01|factory to becoming a paint sprayer in
b05-045-02|a ceramic factory, he can be qualified
b05-045-03|for a completely new job in less time
b05-045-04|than it takes to say" Tolpuddle
b05-045-05|Martyrs!"" CRICKET," says the Oxford
b05-045-06|Dictionary, is" an open air game played
b05-045-07|with ball, bats and wickets between
b05-045-08|# two sides consisting of eleven players
b05-045-09|each." Not so, dear Oxford Dictionary.
b05-050-00|You are out of date. Cricket in 1961 is played
b05-050-01|with a theodolite, six surveyors, a ball;
b05-050-02|bats and wickets between two sides. Shades
b05-050-03|of the village stalwarts of Hambledon who
b05-050-04|are now the patron saints of the game!
b05-050-05|What would THEY have thought of
b05-050-06|these civil engineers creeping about
b05-050-07|the pitch with their optical
b05-050-08|instruments?
b05-055-00|The village green is the real home of cricket. A couple of bumps
b05-055-01|on a pitch have no terrors for a good batsman with a stout
b05-055-02|heart, a firm grip on the willow and a hefty contempt for
b05-055-03|batting averages and all the statistical blight that makes a
b05-055-04|mighty six these days as rare as frostbite in summer.
b05-058-00|They 'll be clapping the man who plays a straight theodolite next.
b05-058-01|EICHMANN continues # to reveal the extraordinary divisions of the
b05-058-02|German mind. Not content with arguing that he was only an
b05-058-03|efficient cog in the machine, he now claims that part of the
b05-058-04|endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was
b05-058-05|" decent, feasible and workable."
b05-062-00|He feels satisfaction" from the fact that my personality had been
b05-062-01|tested and weighed and not found wanting." He feels like
b05-062-02|Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the multitude
b05-062-03|saying:" I am innocent of the blood of this just person."
b05-062-04|Like Dr. Globke, whom I interviewed the other day, Eichmann
b05-062-05|said:
b05-067-00|" I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I
b05-067-01|could despite my low rank." Eichmann is on dangerous ground
b05-067-02|when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base
b05-067-03|of the triangle that led to Hitler, Himmler, Hess and Goering
b05-067-04|at the apex. In examination he betrayed an expert and
b05-067-05|intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that
b05-067-06|led to the top.
b05-071-00|He understood the whole apparatus with an exact and
b05-071-01|meticulous comprehension that could only have come from a man
b05-071-02|who used the system - and used it with power and authority.
b05-071-03|The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid them-
b05-071-04|selves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are
b05-071-05|red with blood.
b05-074-00|They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles
b05-074-01|was an iniquitous injustice. When they burst into
b05-074-02|Czechoslovakia, Poland, Holland, Belgium and France
b05-074-03|they really believed Hitler when he screamed at
b05-074-04|them that they were being" encircled." They really
b05-074-05|believed in the moral superiority of" The New
b05-074-06|Order" which Himmler on October 4, 1943, expressed
b05-074-07|thus:" Whether nations live in prosperity or starve
b05-074-08|to death like cattle interests me only in so far as we
b05-074-09|need them as slaves to # our Kultur; otherwise
b05-074-10|it is of no interest to me.
b05-079-00|This concept of slavery included Britain.
b05-079-01|General Brauchitsch signed a directive
b05-079-02|ordering that after the successful
b05-079-03|invasion of our islands all the" able-bodied
b05-079-04|male population between the ages of
b05-079-05|seventeen and forty-five will, unless the
b05-079-06|local situation calls for an exceptional
b05-079-07|ruling, be interned and dispatched to the
b05-079-08|Continent." The Baltic States were
b05-079-09|to have been our destination.
b05-083-00|In no other conquered country, not even
b05-083-01|Poland, had the Germans begun with such a
b05-083-02|drastic step. There is no doubt that the compatriots
b05-083-03|of Eichmann would have been as good as their
b05-083-04|evil word. THE Inland Revenue people have a
b05-083-05|thankless task. But they do not make
b05-083-06|themselves less disliked by their attitude
b05-083-07|to their customers - who incidentally
b05-083-08|pay their salaries.
b05-088-00|Their demands are invariably couched in
b05-088-01|hectoring, out-of-date language, but in spite of all
b05-088-02|their bluster, they let many a big fish through the
b05-088-03|net while they are bullying the minnows. I have just
b05-088-04|heard a good example of their officious efficiency.
b05-088-05|A young chap I know got his first job last week. He
b05-088-06|is paid monthly in arrears and will not get
b05-088-07|a bean for the next twenty-one days.
b05-098-00|It was called" Abou Ben Adhem and the
b05-098-01|Angel." I don't know why I was so
b05-098-02|impressed with this poem but, on re-
b05-098-03|flection, it might be that I took a
b05-098-04|guilty interest in the devilment busi-
b05-098-05|ness. I may well have felt that I was
b05-098-06|hell-bound under a strict Presbyterian
b05-098-07|upbringing and a possible reprieve might
b05-098-08|come through the sugary sentiments
b05-098-09|of" Abou Ben Adhem."
b06-000-00|SOME 17 years ago, in the early summer of 1934,
b06-000-01|the German ambassador in London was dictating
b06-000-02|a secret report to his chief von Papen, in Berlin.
b06-000-03|" Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion
b06-000-04|of German rearmament, in opposition, to France."
b06-000-05|Later that year he warned that Britain knew
b06-000-06|Germany was breaking the agreement to stop
b06-000-07|building bombers, and added:
b06-004-00|" Without Britain's tolerance German rearma-
b06-004-01|ment in the air would be jeopardised." When
b06-004-02|Hoesch's reports, along with other nazi documents,
b06-004-03|were captured and published after the war the
b06-004-04|pattern of British Government connivance became
b06-004-05|clear. At nazi Germany's request, Britain was
b06-004-06|providing the cloak for Germany to build an
b06-004-07|air force bigger than that of France.
b06-008-00|Yesterday West German Defence Minister,
b06-008-01|Herr Strauss, started talks with the British
b06-008-02|Defence Minister, Mr. Watkinson. Their talks
b06-008-03|are another stage in the cloak operation,
b06-008-04|1961 variety, by which the West German
b06-008-05|militarists are advancing their rearmament.
b06-008-06|Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October
b06-008-07|that his policy was to make his country
b06-008-08|the" strongest militarily in Europe and the
b06-008-09|United States' principal Nato ally."
b06-012-00|His job is to build up the military apparatus which
b06-012-01|will back West Germany's economic domination of Western
b06-012-02|Europe through the Common Market. He continued this week
b06-012-03|the argument with Mr. Watkinson which he had in public at a
b06-012-04|Nato council meeting last year over the question: do we
b06-012-05|fight a 30-day war or a 90-day war?
b06-015-00|A 90-day war, the West German
b06-015-01|view, provides the pretext for huge
b06-015-02|German armed forces ( within Nato
b06-015-03|of course) and for those to have
b06-015-04|bases all over Western Europe.
b06-015-05|In the past year West Germany
b06-015-06|has secured agreements for
b06-015-07|" facilities" in France, Holland and
b06-015-08|Belgium. After much bargaining
b06-015-09|the British Government has
b06-015-10|agreed to give similar" facilities"
b06-019-00|The process has been too slow for Herr
b06-019-01|Strauss and last month he attacked
b06-019-02|Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany's
b06-019-03|plans for a" unified supply apparatus"
b06-019-04|in Nato. ( A supply apparatus which would
b06-019-05|link together the various West German
b06-019-06|" facilities.") By the end of the year there
b06-019-07|will be 11 German divisions in Nato
b06-019-08|compared with four divisions of
b06-019-09|British troops.
b06-023-00|Alongside these divisions a force of over 600
b06-023-01|Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing
b06-023-02|up. These" fighters" are in fact fighter bombers
b06-023-03|which could launch an atomic attack on
b06-023-04|Eastern Europe. By 1963 the Germans plan to have
b06-023-05|nine missile battalions, with 288 missiles and
b06-023-06|36 firing ramps, including weapons like Matador
b06-023-07|( range 950 miles), also provided by the Americans.
b06-027-00|Last month West Germany was
b06-027-01|reported to be halfway toward
b06-027-02|this target. Her position as" America's
b06-027-03|principal Nato ally" grows stronger
b06-027-04|and stronger. Now this target which
b06-027-05|Herr Strauss and his fellows
b06-027-06|have their eyes on is control of the
b06-027-07|warheads to these weapons. General
b06-027-08|Heusinger, the man who caused
b06-027-09|a great disturbance last autumn
b06-032-00|All this has been achieved through Nato under
b06-032-01|American leadership. But a big role has been
b06-032-02|played not only by the British Government but
b06-032-03|by Right-Wing Labour in this country. They have
b06-032-04|helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany,
b06-032-05|in pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet
b06-032-06|policy which brought disaster in 1939.
b06-036-00|Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained
b06-036-01|and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in
b06-036-02|control. Nato, far from being a means of controlling
b06-036-03|the German militarists, is, in fact, the cover for
b06-036-04|building up their power. What must Britain do? Today,
b06-036-05|again, she has a key role. Let her tell men like Strauss
b06-036-06|that he shall have no bases or" facilities," no help in
b06-036-07|his quest for atomic arms.
b06-042-00|A policy which breaks with military
b06-042-01|alliances like Nato and seeks friendship
b06-042-02|with the Soviet Union can prevent another
b06-042-03|betrayal like that of the '30s. Shipbuilding
b06-042-04|Draughtsmen, writing in his personal capa-
b06-042-05|city: * # I WAS pleased to read J. R. Camp-
b06-042-06|bell's article, for, as president of a union
b06-042-07|which fought for and still stands on the
b06-042-08|policy decisions established at the Scar-
b06-042-09|borough Labour Party Conference I am
b06-042-10|appalled at the character of the current
b06-045-00|For many years my union had to present its views
b06-045-01|to the two major conferences of the movement and
b06-045-02|take a licking. For us, unity meant accepting
b06-045-03|unpalatable majority decisions as binding on the
b06-045-04|movement and having a go next time. Alongside
b06-045-05|many others, we conducted our fight by putting
b06-045-06|down # unambiguous alternatives to
b06-045-07|official policy and seeking to win majorities
b06-045-08|for them.
b06-049-00|When Scarborough carried our point of view
b06-049-01|we were naturally delighted, more so because
b06-049-02|the alternatives had been put clearly to the
b06-049-03|movement, which had then chosen a vigorous
b06-049-04|anti-Nato, anti-Tory, anti-bomb and anti-German
b06-049-05|rearmament policy. Hopes rose as we saw a
b06-049-06|perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent
b06-049-07|lines of difference with the Tories. Many members
b06-049-08|understood that the bread-and-butter struggles
b06-049-09|of the union would become easier in the context
b06-053-00|For we have always felt, even
b06-053-01|if we have then by our practice
b06-053-02|ignored it, the inconsistency
b06-053-03|between support for the war
b06-053-04|alliance, with resulting colossal
b06-053-05|spending on armaments, and our
b06-053-06|basic effort to improve living
b06-053-07|standards. Instead, we saw the
b06-053-08|Gaitskellites using the position
b06-053-09|of organisational dominance
b06-053-10|established during their years
b06-056-00|They obstructed every effort to fight for the
b06-056-01|Scarborough decisions, while # scratching
b06-056-02|around frantically to overturn them next
b06-056-03|time. Confusion of the original issue
b06-056-04|by misrepresentation of the decisions,
b06-056-05|the introduction of a pseudo third way
b06-056-06|and the call for party unity - in effect,
b06-056-07|a demand that the movement unite
b06-056-08|with the Gaitskellites on their policy
b06-056-09|and no other seems to have done the
b06-056-10|trick of moving a number of unions
b06-059-00|It would become easy to become cynical and
b06-059-01|to despair. And yet, wherever the issues were put
b06-059-02|clearly, sections of the movement reaffirmed their
b06-059-03|original stand. Only where the issues were
b06-059-04|posed so as to cause doubt and confusion
b06-059-05|were positions lost. It is my view that this
b06-059-06|immediate confusion hides the fact that the
b06-059-07|Peace movement is still advancing and that
b06-059-08|clarification of the issues can bring a
b06-059-09|majority to # secure the Scarborough
b06-059-10|decisions.
b06-064-00|Powerful units have stood firm.
b06-064-01|In unions where the central issues
b06-064-02|were confused, clear policy details -
b06-064-03|as on bases - were decisively carried.
b06-064-04|This, and the numbers of active
b06-064-05|workers who are beginning to understand
b06-064-06|how and why the trick was done,
b06-064-07|provides a strong, immediate basis
b06-064-08|for a campaign against weak and
b06-064-09|doubtful positions, and for a consistent
b06-064-10|peace policy.
b06-068-00|All recent events show how correct the
b06-068-01|Scarborough decisions were. The Kennedy
b06-068-02|Administration's sharpened policies, the
b06-068-03|speeded-up drive to improve West
b06-068-04|Germany's armament, the new attempt
b06-068-05|to rush Britain into the European Common
b06-068-06|Market, and the kite-flying on Spain
b06-068-07|present a whole new proof that to abandon
b06-068-08|Scarborough is to expose Britain and her
b06-068-09|working class to sharp new dangers - that
b06-068-10|Gaitskellism is bankrupt.
b06-071-00|Ordinary working people will never
b06-071-01|rally to defend a policy founded on
b06-071-02|political chicanery or elect a Labour
b06-071-03|Government to carry through Tory policy -
b06-071-04|Gaitskell's stupid hope. The tragedy is
b06-071-05|that enormous inroads could already
b06-071-06|have been made into Tory strength by
b06-071-07|a fighting policy, based on Scarborough.
b06-071-08|THE desire for unity in the Labour and
b06-071-09|trade union movement following the
b06-075-00|At the same time that unity cannot be
b06-075-01|established on a false basis, or by creating
b06-075-02|further confusion within the movement. Unity
b06-075-03|will never be established on the basis of leaders
b06-075-04|being a law unto themselves and opposing
b06-075-05|conference decisions when it suits their own
b06-075-06|convenience. Unity can never be established by
b06-075-07|any formula uniting those who oppose German
b06-075-08|troops being trained on British soil and Polaris,
b06-075-09|and those who are for this policy - which is the
b06-075-10|same as that of the Tory Government.
b06-079-00|It is impossible for Labour's new Defence state-
b06-079-01|ment to unite the movement as the Labour
b06-079-02|leaders are not only in favour of American
b06-079-03|bases, but are in favour of German bases and
b06-079-04|troops being trained on British soil. The new
b06-079-05|Defence statement, while accepting that Britain can-
b06-079-06|not remain an independent nuclear Power, now
b06-079-07|supports the policy of depending on American
b06-079-08|nuclear weapons and the H-bomb, placing
b06-079-09|Britain in an even more dangerous position.
b06-082-00|The statement of Padley and Crossman is no
b06-082-01|different in principle to the new defence statement.
b06-082-02|They accept American nuclear bases, and also
b06-082-03|the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy
b06-082-04|until some future date. They deceive the people
b06-082-05|by their talk of political and collective control
b06-082-06|of Nato. The Pentagon has made it perfectly
b06-082-07|clear who controls the American H-bomb, and
b06-082-08|who will actually give the instructions to press
b06-082-09|the button for nuclear warfare.
b06-087-00|There is only one way to develop unity and
b06-087-01|at the same time defend Britain. This
b06-087-02|was shown at the Scottish Trades Union
b06-087-03|Congress, representing 800,000 organised
b06-087-04|trade unionists, when it decided by overwhelming
b06-087-05|votes, to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions
b06-087-06|on unilateral disarmament, and to oppose
b06-087-07|Polaris and military bases being installed on
b06-087-08|the Holy Loch, or any other part of Britain.
b06-090-00|Such a policy would unite the whole movement
b06-090-01|and lay the basis for the defeat of the
b06-090-02|present Tory Government, which has become a
b06-090-03|real menace to the British people both in
b06-090-04|home and foreign policy. It is quite evident
b06-090-05|that the movement will go on record against
b06-090-06|the Polaris base and facilities for German bases
b06-090-07|and military training.
b06-093-00|This should strengthen the campaign to
b06-093-01|end the manufacture and use of
b06-093-02|nuclear weapons in Britain. Britain then
b06-093-03|could play a leading and independent
b06-093-04|role for an international agreement to ban
b06-093-05|all nuclear strategy and weapons of mass
b06-093-06|destruction, and lay the basis for real
b06-093-07|peace and progress. WHEN all the
b06-093-08|ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training
b06-093-09|Week subsides it is doubtful whether more
b06-093-10|than a handful of new apprenticeships
b06-097-00|This week of window dressing will not prevent
b06-097-01|most of the hopeful 15-year-olds leaving school
b06-097-02|in six weeks time from ending up in blind alley
b06-097-03|jobs. It needs more than 10,000 church parades
b06-097-04|and open days at techs, more than descents into
b06-097-05|Brighton's sewers or balloon ascents over
b06-097-06|Wolverhampton for Britain's technical training to
b06-097-07|catch up with the space age.
b06-100-00|The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh,
b06-100-01|opening a few technical college extensions,
b06-100-02|will not keep us abreast of the
b06-100-03|scientific revolution. Out of the 550,000
b06-100-04|young people aged 15-17 starting
b06-100-05|work in 1960 420000 ( 73 per cent)
b06-100-06|went into unskilled work. The per-
b06-100-07|centage is expected to swell to 80
b06-100-08|next year. The Duke, possibly
b06-100-09|speaking from experience, stated:
b06-110-00|But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
b06-110-01|prefer unskilled jobs. Countless numbers who want training
b06-110-02|are denied it. One area electricity board in 1958
b06-110-03|offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
b06-110-04|applications, of whom 100 were considered suitable by
b06-110-05|the board. There were only 17 vacancies for the 58
b06-110-06|boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth
b06-110-07|dockyard last year.
c01-009-00|The production by Bill Duncalf
c01-009-01|compressed a long and sometimes rambling
c01-009-02|story into a concentrated comprehensive
c01-009-03|survey of a life work. P. J. K. HANS WERNER
c01-009-04|HENZE'S" Elegy for Young Lovers" is the first
c01-009-05|unambiguously" contemporary" work to be
c01-009-06|admitted to the Glyndebourne canon. By no
c01-009-07|means a masterpiece, it is in many respects
c01-009-08|a representative modern work and the composer
c01-009-09|is a highly skilled manipulator of contemporary
c01-009-10|idioms, with a strong sense of words and situation.
c01-014-00|The libretto, by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman,
c01-014-01|is largely a satire on the petty court
c01-014-02|surrounding an ageing poet, whose deeply
c01-014-03|egocentric character leads him to sacrifice
c01-014-04|everything to his need of inspiration. Henze
c01-014-05|obtains his musical characterisation by means
c01-014-06|of individual instrumental timbres and" personal"
c01-014-07|intervals, and the result is often less delineation
c01-014-08|of character than caricature. This is also the chief,
c01-014-09|or at least the most successfully executed trait
c01-014-10|of the libretto, which contains an odd blend of highly
c01-066-00|The evil that Byron did certainly lived after
c01-066-01|him, and was even outmatched by the
c01-066-02|mischief perpetrated by almost every person
c01-066-03|who had been close to him. In turning over
c01-066-04|the bones Doris Langley Moore has brought
c01-066-05|to light a great deal of discreditable
c01-066-06|behaviour and a vision of mischief-
c01-066-07|making propensities of the leisured
c01-066-08|classes in the early 19th century which
c01-066-09|leaves one a little breathless.
c02-000-00|AFTER ten days of intermittent, near fatal
c02-000-01|ennui, the eleventh Berlin International
c02-000-02|Film Festival was suddenly jolted back to
c02-000-03|life by two extraordinary films, Bernhard
c02-000-04|Wicki's" Das Wunder des Malachias" (" The
c02-000-05|Miracle of Father Malachias") and Michael-
c02-000-06|angelo Antonioni's" La Notte." The num-
c02-000-07|ber of German film directors who have
c02-000-08|made first rate works in the last 25 years
c02-000-09|can be counted on the fingers of one
c02-003-00|It would now seem that Wicki's name must
c02-003-01|be added to this list, for his new film
c02-003-02|may well be a landmark in the revitali-
c02-003-03|sation of the German cinema. Wicki is
c02-003-04|not only a director. He began his career
c02-003-05|as an actor, had his first important
c02-003-06|film ro*?5le in Ka"utner's" Die letzt
c02-003-07|Bru"cke," and he also appears in the
c02-003-08|new Antonioni film.
c02-007-00|In 1950 he began to take photographs not
c02-007-01|only in Germany but also in Africa and
c02-007-02|America. An exhibition of these works which
c02-007-03|is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im-
c02-007-04|pressive. As Friedrich Du"rrenmatt, the Swiss
c02-007-05|playwright and author, wrote:" Wicki's blacks
c02-007-06|and greys are not only the colours of the
c02-007-07|lost and the forgotten, but they are also the
c02-007-08|technical means of abstraction.
c02-012-00|Every unnecessary detail, all superfluous local
c02-012-01|colouring must be eliminated. He does not
c02-012-02|want the accuracy of a police photograph,
c02-012-03|but rather he wants to show the eternal in
c02-012-04|every instant." The chilling horror of" Mala-
c02-012-05|chias" is due as much to Wicki the photo-
c02-012-06|grapher as to Wicki the director. His earlier
c02-012-07|film," Die Bru"cke," was equally terrifying,
c02-012-08|but here the director moves out of the world
c02-012-09|of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum
c02-017-00|Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with
c02-017-01|considerable fidelity, the film tells the story
c02-017-02|of a little monk who prays that a disrepu-
c02-017-03|table night club near his church be re-
c02-017-04|moved. One night his prayer is answered
c02-017-05|and the offending establishment is suddenly
c02-017-06|transplanted to an island in the North Sea.
c02-017-07|But Father Malachias's troubles have only
c02-017-08|begun. Instead of having the desired effect,
c02-017-09|the miracle becomes exploited by a group
c02-022-00|Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of
c02-022-01|the missing building. The Church rebukes the
c02-022-02|poor monk for his miracle, and as a
c02-022-03|crowning indignity the night club is
c02-022-04|given a gala society reopening on the
c02-022-05|island. Father Malachias goes to the island,
c02-022-06|prays, and in a second miracle the
c02-022-07|night club is replaced in its original
c02-022-08|setting.
c02-026-00|A summary of the story can give almost
c02-026-01|indication of the scope of Wicki's artistry. He
c02-026-02|tells his story best in the faces of his crowds,
c02-026-03|recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat
c02-026-04|with brutal honesty, building up to a
c02-026-05|tremendous climax in the island orgy.
c02-026-06|Here, the guests arrive in ghost-like yachts,
c02-026-07|the wildly flapping white sails slashed by
c02-026-08|the glaring beacon of a lighthouse.
c02-030-00|When the final miracle does occur, it is accepted as a
c02-030-01|marvellous joke; no one has learned anything. Wicki
c02-030-02|suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue. In
c02-030-03|complete silence he shows the faces of people
c02-030-04|walking in the streets, smug, content, satisfied,
c02-030-05|and thoroughly frightening. Wicki has
c02-030-06|succeeded in his second film in
c02-030-07|recording his personal apocalypse of the
c02-030-08|last days of a sick society.
c02-035-00|It is most unfair to call" Malachias" a cut-rate
c02-035-01|" Dolce Vita," for it is far more intimate and deeply
c02-035-02|felt. In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat
c02-035-03|in" Titanic" by paralleling the last days of the
c02-035-04|Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner,
c02-035-05|and paid for his audacity with his life.
c02-049-00|Strangely enough, the Berlin audience received
c02-049-01|the film with extreme coolness, much preferring
c02-049-02|Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing" Une Femme
c02-049-03|est une Femme," a ninety-one minute hymn
c02-049-04|to" Vogue,"" Cahiers du Cinema," and the
c02-049-05|worst aspects of the American cinema. From
c02-049-06|a brilliantly funny start, the work fizzles
c02-049-07|out into a series of repetitious sight-gags
c02-049-08|and personal jokes incomprehensible to the
c02-049-09|uninitiated ( including four plugs for Charles
c02-049-10|Aznavour).
c02-056-00|This director is at last being re-evaluated and
c02-056-01|given his proper place in the history of the
c02-056-02|German film. Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
c02-056-03|" Unheimliche Geschichten" ( 1920), five ghost stories
c02-056-04|with a light touch, and there was much to admire

c04-000-00|NEXT month that friendly, effervescent performer Frankie
c04-000-01|Vaughan will burst on to the London Palladium stage
c04-000-02|in a new show. To paraphrase his well-known ditty:
c04-000-03|" He 'll have the limelight, they 'll give him the girls -
c04-000-04|and leave the rest to him."
c04-004-00|I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the
c04-004-01|old, star-studded West End than he will ever feel in
c04-004-02|Hollywood. His American bosses, 20th-Century Fox, have
c04-004-03|recently given Frankie the full, razzamataz, red-carpet
c04-004-04|treatment. But they haven't done a thing for his film
c04-004-05|career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not
c04-004-06|doing better here, before the platinum-plated Hollywood
c04-004-07|carrot was dangled before his nose.
c04-008-00|In his first Hollywood picture," Let 's Make Love," he
c04-008-01|was swamped by the know-how of Marilyn Monroe
c04-008-02|and Yves Montand. Against this couple Frankie, in
c04-008-03|a cardboard role, didn't stand a chance. Now comes
c04-008-04|" The Right Approach" ( Rialto," A"), and it 's a glum
c04-008-05|business. He plays an aspiring actor - a
c04-008-06|selfish, arrogant, brash, ambitious, unscrupulous heel -
c04-008-07|who would tread on anybody's neck to get a break in
c04-008-08|the Hollywood ratrace.
c04-013-00|He double-crosses the five pals with whom he lives,
c04-013-01|cheats a waitress ( Juliet Prowse) and cynically uses
c04-013-02|a magazine editress ( Martha Hyer) to get ahead.
c04-013-03|Frankie Vaughan is too nice a chap to ring quite
c04-013-04|true as a smooth-tongued, ill-mannered Yank. His
c04-013-05|best moments are when he swings breezily into the
c04-013-06|title song.
c04-017-00|But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go
c04-017-01|for a new hit song. He might be well advised to
c04-017-02|think hard and long before his next jump into the
c04-017-03|Hollywood arena.
c04-017-04|VERDICT: Vaughan should have by-passed this approach.
c04-017-05|RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the
c04-017-06|Hollywood treatment, thanks to a sound performance in
c04-017-07|" Taste of Fear" ( Warner Theatre," X").
c04-023-00|He has earned his break. The film is a well-made
c04-023-01|variation on that sinister yarn in which half the cast
c04-023-02|try to persuade the heroine that she is out of her mind.
c04-023-03|Despite flagrant cheating the eerie atmosphere is
c04-023-04|built up neatly. Susan Strasberg is the crippled
c04-023-05|damsel in distress.
c04-028-00|Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are
c04-028-01|also effectively around. They provide some chilly red
c04-028-02|herrings in this" Find-the-body" thriller. VERDICT:
c04-028-03|Don't believe all you see and hear!
c04-028-04|NOT for the first time the homely mug of Sidney
c04-028-05|James has pumped life into a slim, strained
c04-028-06|comedy. He does his rescue act in" Double Bunk"
c04-028-07|( Leicester-square Theatre," A").
c04-035-00|Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when
c04-035-01|newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette Scott let
c04-035-02|loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down
c04-035-03|the river. The film starts off brightly enough but,
c04-035-04|half-way through, the plot ( as well as the boat) springs
c04-035-05|a near-disastrous leak. Familiar members of Britain's
c04-035-06|repertory team of comedy character-actors jump through
c04-035-07|equally familiar hoops to mild laughter.
c04-039-00|VERDICT: The" bunk" needed doubling.
c04-039-01|DONALD HOUSTON had a big success on A T V's
c04-039-02|" Drama '61" last night as a smooth,
c04-039-03|scheming jewel thief in a play by Jacques
c04-039-04|Gillies," The Takers." A polished production
c04-039-05|by Quentin Lawrence, here, held together
c04-039-06|by Mr. Houston's accomplished
c04-039-07|performance as the master mind behind a
c04-039-08|gang of crooks.
c04-044-00|This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000
c04-044-01|worth of jewellery struck me as ingenious. The play
c04-044-02|had style, moved at a quick pace and everyone did
c04-044-03|well. But it was Mr. Houston's evening.
c04-044-04|Earlier, on the Palladium show I found Stanley
c04-044-05|Holloway's act too long and not particularly
c04-044-06|entertaining. It was also a mistake to
c04-044-07|re-book Gene Detroy and his performing chimpanzees
c04-044-08|so soon after their previous appearance.
c04-050-00|Their offering last night differed little
c04-050-01|from their earlier act on this show a week
c04-050-02|or so ago. But the Mudlarks, with Jeff Mudd
c04-050-03|out of the Army and back with sister Mary
c04-050-04|and brother Fred, were in bright, zestful
c04-050-05|form. Why only two numbers, though? It
c04-050-06|was not enough." A FAIR COP," the B B C
c04-050-07|Whitehall farce last night, looked like
c04-050-08|a rabbit warren in a field of corn.
c04-056-00|I can't recall a production where so many
c04-056-01|comics bolted in and out of holes so often.
c04-056-02|The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
c04-056-03|lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
c04-056-04|of his trousers. The action moved at tremendous
c04-056-05|speed, backed by some wonderful timing by
c04-056-06|the cast. I especially liked the tea-cup
c04-056-07|scene where six of the cast changed
c04-056-08|cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers.
c04-061-00|Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble
c04-061-01|as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable. They
c04-061-02|alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
c04-061-03|through the gormless standing corn around them. Perhaps
c04-061-04|it was accidental - I hope not. If ever a bag of
c04-061-05|humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall
c04-061-06|farce is it when it comes to television.
c04-066-00|HOW do you get on records? Well, you 've got
c04-066-01|to have something different. Sing slightly flat.
c04-066-02|All the good singers sing in tune. Twang a guitar
c04-066-03|slightly off key. Everybody 's fed up with the
c04-066-04|right way - so the best-seller charts say. Play
c04-066-05|an OLD 2pianna instead of a new one. You got to
c04-066-06|get it into your head, son... people
c04-066-07|don't like things as they should be - not on
c04-066-08|record, anyway.
c04-075-00|Thus, musician David Lisbon's chances of being a starred
c04-075-01|disc solo pianist were greatly enhanced when he dug out
c04-075-02|A PACKET OF DRAWING-PINS." Why not," thought ex-soldier
c04-075-03|Mr. Lisbon, who is twenty-three, and lives in Dagenham, Essex,

c04-075-05|the piano strings?" He did, on his piano at home. There weren't
c04-075-06|enough tacks and he got only the middle hammers done.
c04-080-00|Then he tried it out for sound. Um-chink...
c04-080-01|um-chink... it went. Slightly flat and jangly in
c04-080-02|part. DELIGHTFUL! He put the sound on tape. The
c04-080-03|tape went to the Philips company. Within two
c04-080-04|days Mr. Lisbon had a record contract. And they
c04-080-05|hauled his thumb-tacked joanna the thirteen
c04-080-06|miles to London for his first session.
c04-089-00|Now along comes his solo disc, featuring two of his own
c04-089-01|compositions," Deerstalker" and" Almost Grown Up." VERDICT:
c04-089-02|Mr. Lisbon has it taped. And tacked. And he says:" Just as well
c04-089-03|I had only one box of tacks - it might have been so
c04-089-04|different...." More news from the ivory-thumping dept....
c04-089-05|Russ Conway, who has tinkled his way to fame on an old 2pianna,
c04-089-06|comes in with another of his own works:" Parade of the
c04-089-07|Poppets" ( Columbia).
c04-098-00|But not one of his nimble-fingered best. GERMANY'S Russ
c04-098-01|Conway is a pianist who calls himself CRAZY OTTO. But
c04-098-02|nothing crazy about his pianistics. He pounds merrily away
c04-098-03|at a piece called" Piccadilly" ( Polydor). I find it cute.
c04-098-04|American pianist Floyd Cramer, who played for Elvis on" It 's
c04-098-05|Now or Never," looks like having a success on his own with
c04-098-06|" On the Rebound" ( RCA).
c04-105-00|NEW boy on the vocal front is
c04-105-01|Rolly Daniels, who comes 5,000 miles
c04-105-02|from India to seek disc fame. Comedian Hal
c04-105-03|Monty saw him in Bombay, became his manager.
c04-105-04|And such is Hal's faith that he brings him to
c04-105-05|Europe. Now Rolly gets his big break - a
c04-105-06|record, the modern Aladdin's lamp of
c04-105-07|show business.
c04-122-00|" Let 's have another song with a month in it," said Tolch. Mr.

c04-122-02|tuneful melody sung impeccably by Robert Earl ( Philips). PRODUCER
c04-122-03|Russell Turner, 33, provides his last programme for the B B C tonight
c04-122-04|with Robert Harbin's" Mystery and Magic" ( 7.30). After six years
c04-122-05|with the Corporation, during which he started" Juke Box Jury" and
c04-122-06|directed" Six-Five Special," Turner is aiming to go into free-lance
c04-122-07|T V, film and stage production work.
c04-128-00|" I feel I 've done all I can at the B B C," he
c04-128-01|told me." We mutually agreed to part."
c04-128-02|Escapologist Dill-Russell is a guest in Harbin's
c04-128-03|show tonight. Boxing fans can see an eight-round
c04-128-04|feather-weight contest between Chris Elliot and
c04-128-05|Harry Carroll from Leicester ( B B C, 8.25). A

c04-128-07|Hughes in his" Make Mine Music" ( B B C, 9.30 p.m.).
c06-000-00|IT is mid-morning on a Dublin Sunday. The streets
c06-000-01|are tranquilly sunny and still, for the town
c06-000-02|is at Mass. Most of it. In the front room of
c06-000-03|a house in Anglesey-road is a congregation who
c06-000-04|never actually got to church, but who are
c06-000-05|gathered with devotion around Brendan Behan
c06-000-06|and a brandy bottle.
c06-005-00|Where the 2bhoys are. In the hallway are
c06-005-01|the empties; through the door hearts are
c06-005-02|full, hopes are high. There are still a few
c06-005-03|amber inches in the bottle. Present are some
c06-005-04|hard-core Friends of Brendan. They listen
c06-005-05|with many an obliging guffaw to the
c06-005-06|brandy owner's solo swish on his anecdotal
c06-005-07|roller-coaster, with occasional stops for an old
c06-005-08|I.R.A. air or a Connemara tear-jerker.
c06-014-00|At last Brendan - to the journalist's
c06-014-01|relief - turns his attention to
c06-014-02|the writing scene. He proceeds to
c06-014-03|place himself in the literary hierarchy.
c06-014-04|" I consider myself," he says," a cut
c06-014-05|above Evelyn Waugh socially, a cut
c06-014-06|above Nancy Mitford artistically, a
c06-014-07|cut above Frank Haxell conversationally.
c06-014-08|" But," he continues," the greatest is
c06-014-09|Shelagh Delaney. Just because A Taste
c06-020-00|That 's as bloody silly as calling a Rolls-
c06-020-01|Royce a type of transport. She 's the
c06-020-02|flower in a cultural desert." Now, me - I 'm
c06-020-03|a journalist, I write to entertain rather
c06-020-04|than educate. And I don't write at all
c06-020-05|unless I 'm exceedingly 2skint." But I 'll
c06-020-06|say this. I 'd like to live in America
c06-020-07|and do some writing there.
c06-027-00|It 's a very free place to write in, and there 's
c06-027-01|the advantage that no one knows what
c06-027-02|you 're writing about anyway." Not that I did
c06-027-03|much when I was over this past two times,
c06-027-04|not with that great little Irish bar on
c06-027-05|Seventh Avenue, The Pigsty, always open.
c06-027-06|I was there, in even faster orbit, when that
c06-027-07|third astronaut went up - what 's his name?
c06-031-00|I 'm the only man on earth who doesn't know
c06-031-01|what his name is. Don't tell me. I want to
c06-031-02|preserve that distinction." I already know about
c06-031-03|Shepard and that Salvation Army chap Gagarin -
c06-031-04|the two biggest bores since Cardinal Newman.
c06-031-05|That 's enough of all that hooey." HE plunges
c06-031-06|on into reminiscences of his trips. There is
c06-031-07|much to recall.
c06-039-00|Among other incidents he was banned from New
c06-039-01|York's St. Patrick's Day parade as a" disorderly
c06-039-02|person." He was in a fight after telling a
c06-039-03|Canadian, during a chat about space-flight:
c06-039-04|" Ireland will put a shillelagh into orbit, Israel
c06-039-05|will put a matzo ball into orbit, and Lichtenstein
c06-039-06|will put a postage stamp into orbit before you
c06-039-07|Canadians put up a mouse."
c06-043-00|And he suffered an alcoholic
c06-043-01|seizure and was gravely ill in
c06-043-02|hospital with a diabetic and heart
c06-043-03|condition. His return to Dublin was
c06-043-04|heralded by the announcement that
c06-043-05|he was" off the gargle - a retired
c06-043-06|alcoholic." Since then he has been
c06-043-07|heard of often in the newspapers -
c06-043-08|three times up before the beaks for
c06-043-09|drunk and disorderly conduct.
c06-047-00|LESS has been heard of Brendan's work. It is now
c06-047-01|five years since his first play, The Quare Fellow, was
c06-047-02|produced, three years since Borstal Boy was published
c06-047-03|and The Hostage was put on. What has happened to
c06-047-04|the play, Richard's Cork Leg, begun 18 months ago
c06-047-05|and due for presentation at the Theatre Royal,
c06-047-06|Stratford, last spring? It was never finished.
c06-052-00|What happened to the new book partially tape-recorded
c06-052-01|by his publishers in March of last year? Still a skeleton. Yet
c06-052-02|I have before me now a 12,000-word manuscript of
c06-052-03|a book planned to be called Confessions of an Irish
c06-052-04|Rebel which was delivered to his agents in June. IT
c06-052-05|begins:" There was a party to celebrate Deirdre's
c06-052-06|return from her abortion in Bristol."
c06-058-00|It is ribald, funny, brilliantly observant
c06-058-01|of character, and authentic as a glass
c06-058-02|of draught porter. But will we see its
c06-058-03|end? The last scene of this fragment
c06-058-04|is in a pub where the author throws a
c06-058-05|10 note on to the bar and orders a
c06-058-06|round for the pals, one of whom cries:
c06-076-00|I AM happy to report that I saw some-
c06-076-01|thing this week I have never before witnessed,
c06-076-02|either in pictures or outside - a budgerigar
c06-076-03|playing a drunk scene, and playing it with
c06-076-04|perfect timing and technique. It gives one loud,
c06-076-05|clear hiccup and falls flat on its back. This
c06-076-06|brilliant budge, I may add, gets no credit
c06-076-07|in the cast list of Come September ( Odeon,
c06-076-08|Leicester-square), which suggests that it
c06-076-09|is either using a stand-in for the stunt
c06-080-00|The performance of our talented
c06-080-01|feathered friend is not the only
c06-080-02|good thing ( although the one original
c06-080-03|touch) in the film, which is better-
c06-080-04|than-average glossy comedy, Hollywood-
c06-080-05|styled, European set. Most of it has
c06-080-06|been shot in and around the
c06-080-07|sun-terrace of the Hotel Splendido ( renamed
c06-080-08|the Dolce Vista for the picture) in
c06-080-09|Portofino - and if there 's a better view
c06-087-00|#
c06-087-01|Inevitably there comes the time when Mr. Hudson suddenly breaks
c06-087-02|with tradition and arrives there in July, when, just as
c06-087-03|inevitably, the place is full of American teenagers on an
c06-087-04|escorted tour. Result: Mr. Hudson and lady love Lollo find
c06-087-05|themselves playing chaperon ( Brenda de Banzie, the official
c06-087-06|one, has broken a leg) to the girls, who have just
c06-087-07|been joined by a Jeep-load of boys.
c06-091-00|It 's hereabouts that the budge takes to the bottle, but I
c06-091-01|don't think it was through boredom. The film is funny enough
c06-091-02|in places and has a line or two of painful home truths
c06-091-03|thrown in." I don't want to talk like an adult," screams
c06-091-04|Gina, walking out on the man who has so far
c06-091-05|failed to make an honest woman of her.
c06-095-00|" That 's how I got into all this trouble."
c06-095-01|" He 's got to be 35," says Bobby Darin,
c06-095-02|the chief spokesman of the jeans-and-
c06-095-03|Jeep brigadiers as they 're scheming to
c06-095-04|get rid of old man, solid Rock." How
c06-095-05|many hills can he take?" Of course Mr.
c06-095-06|Hudson can take one more hill than the
c06-095-07|youngsters.
c06-100-00|So all ends as you know it will, with the
c06-100-01|middle-aged romancers respectably wed and
c06-100-02|Master Darin going steady with the delectable
c06-100-03|Sandra Dee ( to whom, I believe, he is married
c06-100-04|in real life). Miss Dee, incidentally, who keeps
c06-100-05|turning up as the typical teenager in all the
c06-100-06|" good girl" parts ( Tuesday Weld gets the" bad girl"
c06-100-07|ones), is becoming quite an accomplished actress.
c06-103-00|THE Marriage-Go-Round ( Carlton)
c06-103-01|is also a comedy of manners,
c06-103-02|but fun-films toting an X
c06-103-03|certificate have to keep a sharp
c06-103-04|look-out that the jokes about
c06-103-05|sex ( what else would they joke
c06-103-06|about with an X?) are of the witty,
c06-103-07|verbal variety and not the visual
c06-103-08|slapstick. This has only one gag -
c06-103-09|that of the entry of a gladiator
c06-106-00|The girl is a knock-out ( see pic-
c06-106-01|ture of Julie Newmar for con-
c06-106-02|firmation). She also has quite a
c06-106-03|mission in mind. She," younger,
c06-106-04|prettier, stronger, and more
c06-106-05|intelligent" than the wife ( as she
c06-106-06|soon tells her), wants to have the
c06-106-07|perfect baby. And she has chosen
c06-106-08|the husband ( James Mason), who
c06-106-09|is an academic friend of her
c06-106-10|Nobel prize-winning father to be
c06-111-00|This sort of situation calls for some subtle,
c06-111-01|slightly sardonic handling. It doesn't get it. But
c06-111-02|The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of
c06-111-03|time. I learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced
c06-111-04|Studies attached to some American universities
c06-111-05|the subject Social Psychology used to be called
c06-111-06|Home-making and is now known as Domestic
c06-111-07|Relations.
c06-116-00|Susan Hayward plays the wife sharply
c06-116-01|and sweetly. Mason is always good for
c06-116-02|a glower. And Miss Newmar is a
c06-116-03|stunner in every sense of the word.
c06-116-04|According to the script she was once
c06-116-05|captain of the junior hockey team at
c06-116-06|her school. So help me so was I.
c06-116-07|IL GRIDO ( The Cry) - Paris Pullman -
c06-116-08|is an earlier essay in atmospheric
c06-116-09|meandering by the L'Avventura man,
c06-116-10|Michelangelo Antonioni.
c06-128-00|ON a March evening in 1932 in the New
c06-128-01|Jersey family household the nursemaid
c06-128-02|tiptoed into the baby's room to see that
c06-128-03|20-month-old Charles Jun. was sleeping.
c06-128-04|Bending over the cot, she suddenly realised
c06-128-05|that there was no sound of breathing.
c06-128-06|She thrust out her hand - and felt
c06-128-07|emptiness. A FEW minutes later the father
c06-128-08|gripping a loaded rifle, told his wife:
c06-138-00|The plain, sober manner of its
c06-138-01|style all the more tellingly
c06-138-02|points up not only the horror
c06-138-03|of the case itself, which
c06-138-04|floundered on to the electrocution
c06-138-05|four years later of a German-
c06-138-06|born Bronx carpenter named
c06-138-07|Bruno Richard Hauptmann, but
c06-138-08|to the raree-show emotionalism
c06-138-09|and sensation-hunger of that
c06-138-10|era.
e01-022-00|Lucky indeed are the families that
e01-022-01|possess a heritage of lace. A lace
e01-022-02|bridal veil handed down from mother
e01-022-03|to daughters, a lace-trimmed Christening
e01-022-04|robe that each generation wears in turn -
e01-022-05|these are proud possessions, linked to the
e01-022-06|exquisite lace-making of the past.
e01-025-00|But lace-making is by no means a lost
e01-025-01|art. It suffered a decline and fell into
e01-025-02|lamentably low standards in the fussy
e01-025-03|over-furnishing of the Victorian age
e01-025-04|but it would take more than a temporary
e01-025-05|lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely,
e01-025-06|viable craft. It has, in fact, readily
e01-025-07|adapted itself to modern tastes and the ill-
e01-025-08|ustrations in the following pages will show
e01-025-09|how completely it is in sympathy with con-
e01-025-10|temporary surroundings.
e01-029-00|It will be seen how, with bold design
e01-029-01|and rich colour, knitting, crochet and
e01-029-02|tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons
e01-029-03|can give striking individuality to many things
e01-029-04|in the home. Chairbacks, cushions, tablecloths,
e01-029-05|to mention only three - how satisfying it is
e01-029-06|to avoid the ready-made in these and by
e01-029-07|one's own handiwork produce something
e01-029-08|that reflects true creative talent.
e01-032-00|The more delicate patterns and finer
e01-032-01|threads may be reserved to bring a light
e01-032-02|and lovely touch to personal possessions -
e01-032-03|a lace border to a handkerchief, fine-lace
e01-032-04|insertion on a petticoat or blouse, a tatted edge
e01-032-05|to a collar; these add a charming, feminine
e01-032-06|distinction that nothing else can give.
e01-032-07|Although we assess lace-making as one of
e01-032-08|the feminine skills, a number of the well-loved
e01-032-09|traditional patterns that we follow today were,
e01-032-10|in fact, the brain-children of inventive men.
e01-035-00|For in the old order of things, men designed
e01-035-01|and worked lace as well as women and
e01-035-02|special schools were set up to teach lace-
e01-035-03|making not only to young girls, but to little
e01-035-04|boys as well. Whole families made their
e01-035-05|livelihood by lace-making and consequently
e01-035-06|a folklore of song, festival and courtship grew
e01-035-07|up around the lace industry.
e01-050-00|During the sixteenth century a considerable
e01-050-01|amount of crochet was produced in the
e01-050-02|convents of Europe. Without doubt it was the
e01-050-03|nuns who carried the craft to Ireland. There it
e01-050-04|was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
e01-050-05|form with rosettes, leaves and lace fillings. During
e01-050-06|the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
e01-050-07|greatly abused.
e01-059-00|In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris
e01-059-01|hand-crocheted blouses, gossamer fine in
e01-059-02|texture, are sold at a very high price. With a
e01-059-03|little time and concentration the woman at home can
e01-059-04|produce fashion articles as elegant as those of
e01-059-05|Paris - a blouse, delicate gloves or a fine
e01-059-06|edging for collar, cuffs or a handkerchief.
e01-062-00|In the home, crochet lace can be used to make
e01-062-01|tablecloths, traycloths and runners, and edgings
e01-062-02|from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
e01-062-03|functions. The art of crochet is not difficult and
e01-062-04|it is reasonably quick to work. In the following
e01-062-05|pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
e01-062-06|to enable the beginner to master all the essential
e01-062-07|crochet stitches.
e01-081-00|First launder crochet and then pin to the required
e01-081-01|shape, ensuring that all lines of the crochet are
e01-081-02|accurate. Place crochet in correct position on linen and
e01-081-03|secure with pins. Run a line of basting stitches
e01-081-04|on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
e01-081-05|which are to be attached to the linen. Remove crochet.
e01-086-00|Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen:
e01-086-01|( a) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches,
e01-086-02|the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the
e01-086-03|outside edge. Oversew crochet to button stitch.
e01-086-04|( b) Turn under a small hem, with fold lying on line
e01-086-05|of basting stitches. Work a row of dc all round
e01-086-06|this hem, with 3 dc at each corner.
e01-092-00|Oversew crochet to the dc. A household word,
e01-092-01|Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities which
e01-092-02|are of the utmost importance to the worker.
e01-092-03|It washes beautifully, never loses its colour
e01-092-04|nor becomes ' stringy ', is very elastic and
e01-092-05|preserves the beauty of the design. It is easy
e01-092-06|to work with, soft, glossy and of uniform
e01-092-07|thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread.
e01-102-00|Remember that texture plays an important part in
e01-102-01|the beauty of crochet. The finer mercerised threads
e01-102-02|are more effective for the delicate designs used for
e01-102-03|tablecloths, doilies, edgings and accessories, while
e01-102-04|the heavier threads are used for bedspreads,
e01-102-05|chairbacks, luncheon mats, etc. Crochet hooks
e01-102-06|are made of steel, composition or bone. Steel
e01-102-07|crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0,
e01-102-08|the largest, to number 8, the smallest.
e01-107-00|Each size of hook is made for use with a certain
e01-107-01|size of thread. To ensure the correct results,
e01-107-02|it is important that you use the size of hook
e01-107-03|specified in the directions. These are the
e01-107-04|correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet:
e01-107-05|Directions are given for a small practice
e01-107-06|piece for each stitch that you learn. When
e01-107-07|you have become proficient in these
e01-107-08|stitches, attractive articles can be made
e01-107-09|from the directions included in this book.
e01-113-00|1. Grasp thread near end between thumb
e01-113-01|and forefinger. 2. Make a loop by
e01-113-02|lapping long thread over short thread.
e01-113-03|3. Hold loop in place between thumb
e01-113-04|and forefinger ( Fig. 1). 1. Take hold
e01-113-05|of broad bar of hook as you would a
e01-113-06|pencil. Bring middle finger forward to
e01-113-07|rest near tip of hook.
e01-119-00|2. Insert hook through loop and under long
e01-119-01|thread. Catch long end of thread ( Fig. 2).
e01-119-02|Draw loop through. 3. Do not remove hook
e01-119-03|from thread. Pull short end and ball thread
e01-119-04|in opposite directions to bring loop close around
e01-119-05|the end of the hook, but not too tight
e01-119-06|( Fig. 3). Loop thread round little finger,
e01-119-07|across palm and behind forefinger ( Fig. 4).
e02-000-00|A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
e02-000-01|legs, and in reproduction period pieces they
e02-000-02|are frequently used. The simpler varieties are
e02-000-03|extremely easy to work, the four sides being
e02-000-04|simply planed to give the required taper. In
e02-000-05|the more elaborate varieties, however, a toe is
e02-000-06|worked in the solid, and this certainly
e02-000-07|complicates the operation.
e02-014-00|For short ones a smoothing plane can be used.
e02-014-01|The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
e02-014-02|on the newly planed surfaces, and these treated
e02-014-03|as before. It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
e02-014-04|the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth
e02-014-05|of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
e02-014-06|straight.
e02-018-00|A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
e02-018-01|end reveals when the required amount
e02-018-02|has been removed, and if care is taken
e02-018-03|to stop the plane short of the squared
e02-018-04|pencil line at the top, the work will be
e02-018-05|accurate. The straight-edge can be used
e02-018-06|to test the straightness of the sides.
e02-021-00|Incidentally, it is better to
e02-021-01|complete any mortising that may be
e02-021-02|needed at the top before the tapering is
e02-021-03|begun. Some plain tapered legs have
e02-021-04|the taper on the two inner faces only,
e02-021-05|the outer surfaces being vertical as
e02-021-06|at ( B), Fig. 1. To make a leg such as
e02-021-07|that at ( D), Fig. 1, the square is first
e02-021-08|marked out as at ( A), Fig. 3.
e02-025-00|Note that squared lines marking
e02-025-01|the top member of the toe are
e02-025-02|needed as well as the upper ex-
e02-025-03|tent of the taper, and in
e02-025-04|this case it is necessary to
e02-025-05|mark in the line of the taper
e02-025-06|with pencil and straight-edge
e02-025-07|as at ( B), Fig. 3. A saw cut is
e02-025-08|made at the upper toe line
e02-025-09|exactly down to the taper line,
e02-025-10|no farther.
e02-074-00|But why woodwork in particular? Well, there
e02-074-01|are many reasons. Wood is in good and
e02-074-02|common supply; it lends itself to making
e02-074-03|innumerable useful household items -
e02-074-04|furniture, fitments, garden items, toys, etc.;
e02-074-05|it enables results to be obtained fairly
e02-074-06|quickly; it is less expensive than most
e02-074-07|other materials; it is a pleasant material
e02-074-08|to work with; and, although it does
e02-074-09|create a certain amount of mess, it is
e02-074-10|all clean and easily cleared away.
e02-082-00|This last point is certainly important because almost
e02-082-01|everyone has come to recognise that machines
e02-082-02|are not only an economic necessity, but that a
e02-082-03|great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
e02-082-04|installation of a power tool. As an elementary
e02-082-05|example, surely no one can pretend to enjoy
e02-082-06|ripping out parts from hardwood. Most men
e02-082-07|would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
e02-082-08|were available.
e02-086-00|Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin
e02-086-01|with what we have called a bare minimum kit. Probably
e02-086-02|most men have some of the tools already. It will enable
e02-086-03|a man to make simple, straight-forward things, and in
e02-086-04|any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
e02-086-05|which other tools can be added as the need arises. The
e02-086-06|nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
e02-086-07|to be made, but as a guide we have given a fuller kit
e02-086-08|which increases the range of things that can be
e02-086-09|made enormously.
e02-091-00|As a still further development, we follow
e02-091-01|with a good basic kit, which includes
e02-091-02|the fuller kit ( which in its turn, of course,
e02-091-03|includes the bare minimum kit).
e02-091-04|With this the vast majority of jobs
e02-091-05|can be done, though for advanced
e02-091-06|cabinet work the necessity for
e02-091-07|certain special tools will become
e02-091-08|obvious.
e02-094-00|Lastly, we suggest certain power tools and
e02-094-01|machines, the choice of which will
e02-094-02|depend partly upon the space available
e02-094-03|in the workshop, the amount one
e02-094-04|is prepared to pay, and the type of
e02-094-05|work a man normally does. First,
e02-094-06|however, a word of advice generally.
e02-094-07|Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
e02-094-08|machines. They never are cheap in the
e02-094-09|long run. They may be inaccurate,
e02-100-00|Most tools have to lead an intensive life, and faults
e02-100-01|in design or quality soon become apparent. It is far
e02-100-02|better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
e02-100-03|quality, and not handicap yourself from the start.
e02-100-04|To put it in a slightly different way, do not allow
e02-100-05|yourself to blame the tools when the job does
e02-100-06|not turn out quite right!
e02-117-00|Many men with only limited accommodation
e02-117-01|have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table.
e02-117-02|Providing this is sound, some perfectly good
e02-117-03|work can be done on it, but the usual problems
e02-117-04|are those of the vice, the bench stop, and storage
e02-117-05|place for tools. The combined bench top and
e02-117-06|tool cupboard shown here has been specially
e02-117-07|designed and made for WOODWORKER
e02-117-08|readers who have this difficulty.
e04-000-00|HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the
e04-000-01|family man or father-to-be. Unlike many
e04-000-02|commercial articles, this chair is solidly built and
e04-000-03|capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
e04-000-04|most destructive youngster. Almost any available
e04-000-05|timber can be used but Parana pine is
e04-000-06|recommended, being cheap, easy to work, and
e04-000-07|taking a good finish.
e04-004-00|Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
e04-004-01|timber as shown in Fig. 1. Although the timber will have already
e04-004-02|been machine planed, remember to go over each piece with
e04-004-03|a smoothing plane, otherwise the marks left by the cutters
e04-004-04|will show up after painting. The dimensions given enable the
e04-004-05|feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table, but the height
e04-004-06|can be altered if required.
e04-008-00|All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned,
e04-008-01|which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat
e04-008-02|appearance. The side frames are joined by four cross pieces
e04-008-03|each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses ( C),
e04-008-04|cut to fit them.
e04-011-00|See Fig. 2. These are then glued and
e04-011-01|pinned into place. A similar piece of 1 in.
e04-011-02|by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across
e04-011-03|the end of the feeding tray as seen in
e04-011-04|Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of
e04-011-05|hardboard is covered with plastic material
e04-011-06|for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath
e04-011-07|the frame with panel pins to complete
e04-011-08|the feeding tray.
e04-015-00|Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
e04-015-01|fits up against the front legs of the
e04-015-02|chair. The seat rests across the upper two
e04-015-03|cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood
e04-015-04|glued and panel pinned in position, measurements
e04-015-05|being taken directly from the work. Fig. 4
e04-015-06|shows the framework for the back which
e04-015-07|is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber.
e04-019-00|The amount of the backward tilt and
e04-019-01|also the height is left to personal choice
e04-019-02|and the width is best taken directly
e04-019-03|from the work to ensure a good fit.
e04-019-04|Fix the piece A to the sides first
e04-019-05|with glue and panel pins and then fit
e04-019-06|the frame together with the piece
e04-019-07|B temporarily in place on the chair
e04-019-08|frame.
e04-022-00|Decide on the required angle of slope,
e04-022-01|keeping B flat on the chair seat, and mark
e04-022-02|off the exact position of B on the side
e04-022-03|pieces. These can then be cut at the correct
e04-022-04|angle and B is glued and nailed in place.
e04-022-05|A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned
e04-022-06|to the frame and its edges planed off
e04-022-07|flush.
e04-026-00|Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with
e04-026-01|screws driven from the inside. The footrest is a
e04-026-02|piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in.
e04-026-03|by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair
e04-026-04|of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5. When determining
e04-026-05|the position of the footrest, do not place too near
e04-026-06|the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs.
e04-030-00|To complete the job, screw two fittings to the
e04-030-01|inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
e04-030-02|back to hold the baby's safety harness. These can be
e04-030-03|made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
e04-030-04|wire as shown in Fig. 6. Make sure that these
e04-030-05|are well secured as they will have to withstand
e04-030-06|considerable pulling as the child becomes older.
e04-034-00|Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes
e04-034-01|with plastic wood. Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
e04-034-02|framework and round off any sharp edges ( such as the
e04-034-03|edge of the seat, feeding tray, etc). Fill the grain with a
e04-034-04|woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
e04-034-05|a suitable pastel shade, using a contrasting colour
e04-034-06|for the seat and the back which can be decorated with
e04-034-07|a suitable nursery transfer.
e04-038-00|Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
e04-038-01|if junior decides to bite the chair. Finally, it is as well
e04-038-02|to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
e04-038-03|material that might be available as otherwise the
e04-038-04|paint would soon be scratched off.
e04-038-05|( J.H.P.) BUILDING your own boat is a most
e04-038-06|satisfying and worthwhile project.
e04-043-00|Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
e04-043-01|rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
e04-043-02|sold. It is especially designed for simplicity in
e04-043-03|construction, cheapness and lightness of weight,
e04-043-04|and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
e04-043-05|weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
e04-043-06|and an outboard motor with a comfortable
e04-043-07|margin of freeboard.
e04-052-00|For instance, in Canada we use galvanised nails
e04-052-01|in place of screws. We just bend them over and clamp
e04-052-02|firmly by using a hammer on each side. Over here I 've
e04-052-03|always used brass screws, which are more expensive. The first
e04-052-04|job is to make your moulds. In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply,
e04-052-05|but to save money any scrap may be used, and if this
e04-052-06|is nailed and glued together strongly, it may be marked
e04-052-07|and cut to shape later.
e04-058-00|If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
e04-058-01|the moulds, make a frame of rough lumber as shown in
e04-058-02|Fig. 2. The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
e04-058-03|rigid as possible, for it is on these you will be building
e04-058-04|and shaping your little craft, upside-down. For cheapness
e04-058-05|I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
e04-058-06|Columbia.
e04-062-00|This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
e04-062-01|a permanently water proof glue line. Be sure to
e04-062-02|see that the edge bears the mark, P.M.B.C. Exterior.
e04-062-03|This may be bought at any good timber merchants.
e04-062-04|The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
e04-062-05|wood of the same make, or oak or mahogany. For the
e04-062-06|last one I made, I used the two flaps from an old
e04-062-07|mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one
e04-062-08|shilling.
e04-068-00|I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
e04-068-01|rowing this dinghy ( Fig. 3). They are very simple, cheap
e04-068-02|and easy to make. As will be seen from the plan
e04-068-03|there is only a single gunwale on the outside.
e04-068-04|I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
e04-068-05|is difficult to obtain here and expensive. I overcome
e04-068-06|this in another way as shown in Fig. 4.
e04-079-00|Cut the moulds and the
e04-079-01|transoms to shape as in the
e04-079-02|detailed drawings. If you have
e04-079-03|a wooden floor you can use
e04-079-04|' A ' frames fastened to the floor
e04-079-05|if not, use a strong horizontal
e04-079-06|frame that will sit firmly on
e04-079-07|the ground or concrete floor. I
e04-079-08|use a heavy old base as in
e04-079-09|Fig. 2.
e04-083-00|The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
e04-083-01|correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat.
e04-083-02|Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
e04-083-03|to allow for the chines to rest in these
e04-083-04|notches, as they are not fastened to the
e04-083-05|moulds, which will only be used whilst
e04-083-06|the hull is under construction.
e04-086-00|The chine is the long stringer on each side which
e04-086-01|is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves
e04-086-02|cut in the moulds. Each chine is made of oak,
e04-086-03|ash, spruce or any long grained flexible wood. I
e04-086-04|prefer spruce when available. As will be seen
e04-086-05|in the plan, the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in.
e04-086-06|on each side.
e04-091-00|The chines are morticed into this and butt up
e04-091-01|against the transom. Start at the bow and
e04-091-02|spring them both at the same time over the
e04-091-03|slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
e04-091-04|cut for this purpose in the stern or after
e04-091-05|transom framing. Glue, screw and make fast.
e04-095-00|The skeleton of the boat will now take shape,
e04-095-01|and this is the time to check before making fast
e04-095-02|to see that nothing is distorted. Ensure that
e04-095-03|the outside measurements from transom to transom
e04-095-04|are equal on each side and that the transoms
e04-095-05|are parallel horizontally. Next bevel the chines
e04-095-06|with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly.
e04-099-00|Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
e04-099-01|plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
e04-099-02|planing after fixing to the boat. Use your two
e04-099-03|lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
e04-099-04|purpose, the sides from one, and the bottom from
e04-099-05|the other. If care is taken not to waste the
e04-099-06|ply, plenty of material is left over for the thwarts.
e04-103-00|Having trimmed up the chines, we are now ready
e04-103-01|to plank the sides. Start again at the bows,
e04-103-02|clamping into position with a ' D ' clamp. Bend
e04-103-03|round the frame to the stern and clamp there. If
e04-103-04|you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
e04-103-05|well. After generously covering with glue, screw
e04-103-06|the sides to the transom framing and the chine.
e04-109-00|Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass) or nail
e04-109-01|with inch and a quarter galvanized nails, if
e04-109-02|you are doing it that way. Use flat head screws
e04-109-03|about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in
e04-109-04|the 1/4 in. ply. Make a very small hole for
e04-109-05|the screw to allow for a good grip. Remember
e04-109-06|to glue before screwing.
e04-114-00|Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom,
e04-114-01|which is cut in one piece. It should overlap just a
e04-114-02|trifle; this can be cleaned up later. As you are
e04-114-03|screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
e04-114-04|necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
e04-114-05|the screws. I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
e04-114-06|the bottom, both for screwing to the chines and
e04-114-07|the bottom shaped transom facing.
e04-119-00|Again, don't forget to glue. Now put on the keel and
e04-119-01|the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off
e04-119-02|the moulds. You won't want them again for this boat, so
e04-119-03|shift them right out of the way. Place the boat right side
e04-119-04|up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for
e04-119-05|working.
e04-124-00|Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts ( seats)
e04-124-01|taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats
e04-124-02|with vertical members as shown in the plans. Make the
e04-124-03|four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions
e04-124-04|before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
e04-124-05|a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside ( gunwale)
e04-124-06|one to fit the block.
e04-127-00|I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
e04-127-01|with copper nails and roves. It greatly improves the
e04-127-02|appearance and the strength. Paint with good marine primer,
e04-127-03|undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint.
e04-127-04|WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
e04-127-05|into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either
e04-127-06|making fabric pictures or designs.
e04-132-00|While these may ultimately be made into a picture
e04-132-01|for framing and hanging on a wall, they may
e04-132-02|also be arranged into a design, and the
e04-132-03|resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful
e04-132-04|article.
e07-000-00|WE have not yet reached the stage in Britain
e07-000-01|when 50 planes are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons
e07-000-02|of DDT and fuel oil over 3 million acres or when
e07-000-03|20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin. An eye-
e07-000-04|witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with
e07-000-05|the stench of small game and birds dead from insecti-
e07-000-06|cide poisoning.
e07-003-00|Wholesale chemical spraying, upsetting as it
e07-003-01|does the balance of nature by killing both pests
e07-003-02|and predators, is viewed with concern by a
e07-003-03|number of American State Research Stations. Not
e07-003-04|content with issuing bulletins on the dangers
e07-003-05|of the misuse of chemicals in agriculture,
e07-003-06|some stations are carrying out useful research on
e07-003-07|pest control by biological means. Both native and
e07-003-08|imported predatory insects and insect pathogens
e07-003-09|are used in field trial tests.
e07-007-00|The biological control of pests in the garden
e07-007-01|is not new to the American gardener. Lady-
e07-007-02|birds figure in press advertisements, their
e07-007-03|sale being by the gallon. Praying mantis ( Mantis
e07-007-04|religiosa), both native and" immigrant" varieties,
e07-007-05|are used by gardeners in all parts of the United
e07-007-06|States. Advertisements offer eggs of European,
e07-007-07|Chinese or native forms of mantis.
e07-012-00|From the day it hatches in the spring
e07-012-01|until it dies in the late autumn, the
e07-012-02|praying mantis satisfies its voracity by
e07-012-03|eating other insects. Nine blowflies
e07-012-04|may be consumed at one sitting and
e07-012-05|the fully adult, 2 1/2-in.-long insect,
e07-012-06|is able to keep a firm hold on one
e07-012-07|grasshopper while eating another.
e07-012-08|According to Dr. Max Beier in" Fang-
e07-012-09|heuschrecken" ( Die Neue Brehm Bu"ckerei,
e07-012-10|1952), the praying mantis is trecking
e07-012-11|northwards.
e07-061-00|Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an
e07-061-01|egg-case of the Chinese mantis. The
e07-061-02|first mantis had hatched from the very large
e07-061-03|egg-case on June 6. Both the Chinese
e07-061-04|and Spanish mantis, in the young stage
e07-061-05|at any rate, are light brown in colour.
e07-061-06|Because of the cool, wet weather, I had great
e07-061-07|difficulty in breeding fruit flies and, after
e07-061-08|many of the mantis of both types had died
e07-061-09|in my Kilner jars, I poured living mantis
e07-061-10|over vines and peachtrees.
e07-066-00|A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in
e07-066-01|Grantham, Lincs, kindly offered to
e07-066-02|cooperate with me in studying praying
e07-066-03|mantis as a pest control in the cold
e07-066-04|greenhouse. Of the dozen Spanish mantis
e07-066-05|sent him by post on June 22, only two or
e07-066-06|three survived the journey; one thrived
e07-066-07|and the latest report I have is that
e07-066-08|this mantis is still alive.
e07-072-00|DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes
e07-072-01|since the end of the war, clay pots are
e07-072-02|still in greatest demand. It is mostly
e07-072-03|in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
e07-072-04|have made headway, and although
e07-072-05|numerous small clay pots are used each
e07-072-06|year, they are fewer than they were 10
e07-072-07|years ago. In the larger sizes there is still
e07-072-08|no real substitute for clay that can be
e07-072-09|obtained at a comparable price, except the
e07-072-10|bituminized paper pots which are used on
e07-072-11|commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
e07-076-00|The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
e07-076-01|brittle nature; even with reasonably careful
e07-076-02|handling, the annual losses are often around
e07-076-03|10 per cent., and where the handling and
e07-076-04|storage facilities are not too good, these
e07-076-05|losses will be even greater. This does not
e07-076-06|necessarily apply to the larger sizes, as
e07-076-07|they are not quite so fragile as the
e07-076-08|smaller ones and are not normally thrown
e07-076-09|about in quite the same way.
e07-079-00|The storage problem puts clay pots at a
e07-079-01|definite disadvantage. They are fairly heavy
e07-079-02|and difficult things to accommodate and
e07-079-03|they must have some protection from severe
e07-079-04|weather, which can be quite a headache in
e07-079-05|a small garden. While admitting that
e07-079-06|broken pots have on occasions provided
e07-079-07|artists with delightful studies, there is no
e07-079-08|doubt that a pile of badly stacked,
e07-079-09|half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
e07-079-10|from any point of view.
e07-083-00|Every garden boy will agree that having to
e07-083-01|wash clay pots is a definite factor in
e07-083-02|favour of their abolition; in fact one
e07-083-03|young man was so wholehearted about this
e07-083-04|a few years ago that he made the headlines
e07-083-05|for having smashed a large number # to
e07-083-06|relieve his feelings. On the small-to-medium
e07-083-07|establishment, it is a disagreeable chore
e07-083-08|which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm,
e07-083-09|whereas on larger establishments the pots
e07-083-10|can be sterilized or washed by machine.
e07-086-00|It is not easy to make an economic
e07-086-01|comparison between clay pots and the various
e07-086-02|substitutes; the former may last indefinitely
e07-086-03|with luck, while the latter are often
e07-086-04|expendable used only once. Clay pots are
e07-086-05|efficient and congenial containers in which
e07-086-06|to grow plants. In their proper setting they
e07-086-07|are not unattractive and, in spite of
e07-086-08|their shortcomings, most gardeners have
e07-086-09|a nostalgic affection for them.
e07-090-00|Present-day pots are better finished, do
e07-090-01|not get dirty so readily and are easier to
e07-090-02|wash. The deep rims make for neater and
e07-090-03|safer stacking, though they are still
e07-090-04|expensive and still get broken. On the
e07-090-05|other hand, there is really no replacement
e07-090-06|for the larger sizes, so they have the
e07-090-07|decided advantage of being the only
e07-090-08|suitable container available in quantity
e07-090-09|for fairly large plants.
e07-094-00|Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
e07-094-01|pots for plant raising. These are compressed blocks of
e07-094-02|compost, made in a specially devised press to
e07-094-03|simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot.
e07-094-04|Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape, they
e07-094-05|are made of the same compost as would have
e07-094-06|been used in a pot, the # only difference being
e07-094-07|that it is used in a slightly moister
e07-094-08|condition.
e07-098-00|Seed is sown, or seedlings are pricked out into them
e07-098-01|in the normal way, the only real difference
e07-098-02|being that more of the watering is done through a
e07-098-03|rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
e07-098-04|of water. First-class plants of tomatoes,
e07-098-05|cucumbers, marrows, melons, cauliflowers,
e07-098-06|celery and onions, may all be raised in soil
e07-098-07|blocks; so can such flowering plants as
e07-098-08|dahlias, chrysanthemums, salvias, sweet peas,
e07-098-09|lupins and numerous others.
e07-101-00|One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
e07-101-01|one: the cost of a pot of any description is saved
e07-101-02|completely. Manufacturing the block and planting
e07-101-03|it is very little more trouble than normal potting,
e07-101-04|and a superior plant, which transplants more
e07-101-05|easily, is produced. The obvious limitation #
e07-101-06|is that soil blocks can only be used for
e07-101-07|propagating; there can be no progression to a
e07-101-08|larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
e07-101-09|to be moved; it must be planted out or
e07-101-10|potted.
e07-105-00|Many amateur gardeners might improve their
e07-105-01|results by buying a small hand-operated soil
e07-105-02|block maker and use the money saved on
e07-105-03|buying small pots to improve their composts.
e07-105-04|The various types of small paper pots are very
e07-105-05|useful for short-term operations, but are
e07-105-06|inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
e07-105-07|too long.
e07-108-00|They are # quite useful for plants that are
e07-108-01|despatched to market or direct to customers,
e07-108-02|their cheapness making them attractive to the
e07-108-03|nurseryman; there is also considerable saving
e07-108-04|in carriage costs because of their lightness.
e07-108-05|There are many types of plastic pots available;
e07-108-06|some expensive, some quite cheap; some good
e07-108-07|and others not so good. A wide range of
e07-108-08|plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
e07-108-09|usually need less water than those in clay
e07-108-10|pots.
e07-112-00|They are slightly more difficult to
e07-112-01|manage, however, until a little experience
e07-112-02|has been gained with them. Plastic pots
e07-112-03|are usually more expensive than clay ones,
e07-112-04|but they are almost indestructible and
e07-112-05|will last a long time with normal care.
f01-053-00|The job of the teacher is to set the learner's
f01-053-01|vocabulary to work on the existing store
f01-053-02|so as to make it grow. He does not
f01-053-03|simply pack new things into the store.
f01-053-04|The solitary learner has to find out
f01-053-05|how to do this for himself, with the help
f01-053-06|of books. He uses his vocabulary to
f01-053-07|ask questions and uses the books to
f01-053-08|find the answers.
f01-058-00|Thus learning how to learn means becoming
f01-058-01|your own philosopher, your own psychologist
f01-058-02|and your own teacher. You will then be
f01-058-03|a well-established learner and the world
f01-058-04|will be at your feet. Although the word
f01-058-05|" mind" has given rise to endless
f01-058-06|controversy among philosophers and psycho-
f01-058-07|logists, many of whom would like to
f01-058-08|abolish it from the dictionary, most
f01-058-09|of us obstinately go on using it.
f01-066-00|And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
f01-066-01|" mind" vanishes, at any rate for some time. It seems very difficult
f01-066-02|to detach the mind from the brain, and all the biological,
f01-066-03|surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
f01-066-04|close connection. There is a lot to be said for keeping the
f01-066-05|word" soul" to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable
f01-066-06|essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
f01-066-07|the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word" mind" for
f01-066-08|the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
f01-066-09|are clearly associated with the brain.
f01-070-00|Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
f01-070-01|picture of this" basis" of mental phenomena?
f01-070-02|The physicists have succeeded remarkably well,
f01-070-03|with the atomic theory, in giving a clear and detailed
f01-070-04|picture of the basis of such material phenomena
f01-070-05|as chemical action, magnetism, the behaviour of
f01-070-06|gases and so on. Where has psychology got to in its
f01-070-07|theories of" mind"? Are there any ultimate units
f01-070-08|of mind akin to the atoms of matter?
f01-075-00|At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
f01-075-01|be analysed into discrete bits. These bits were
f01-075-02|identified as elementary sensations. These were
f01-075-03|thought to combine together to form compound
f01-075-04|experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
f01-075-05|matter combine to form molecular compounds.
f01-075-06|But this view led to too many difficulties and
f01-075-07|was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search
f01-075-08|for basic units of mind has gone on and will
f01-075-09|doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to
f01-075-10|discover ultimate units.
f01-081-00|We must beware, however, of supposing that there must be any
f01-081-01|close analogy between the units of quite different
f01-081-02|sciences. For example the success of the atomic theory
f01-081-03|in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
f01-081-04|units of geometry must be points. It would be more
f01-081-05|correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
f01-081-06|geometry.
f01-085-00|There have been many conflicting tendencies in
f01-085-01|psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
f01-085-02|we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
f01-085-03|concept which is current today. It is known as the schema.
f01-085-04|It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
f01-085-05|concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
f01-085-06|but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction.
f01-135-00|It is the tendency to get things
f01-135-01|the wrong way round. As a
f01-135-02|psychologist I am constantly
f01-135-03|encountering this tendency
f01-135-04|in friends and acquaintances.
f01-135-05|They think there is something
f01-135-06|inevitably" queer" about psychology
f01-135-07|and this feeling of queerness
f01-135-08|usually boils down to a quite
f01-135-09|mistaken belief that the
f01-135-10|psychologist first looks into...
f01-139-00|This is what I mean by" getting things the wrong way
f01-139-01|round". He is far more likely to find out about how
f01-139-02|his own mind works by looking at other people's.
f01-139-03|For although looking inwards ( or" introspecting"
f01-139-04|as it is called), is not entirely ruled out,
f01-139-05|nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
f01-139-06|one of the most unreliable methods of getting
f01-139-07|any precise information.
f01-143-00|And so they prefer objective methods. Since they cannot
f01-143-01|directly look into the mental processes of another
f01-143-02|person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
f01-143-03|to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
f01-143-04|this behaviour. This is no more queer than the method
f01-143-05|of the doctor who observes signs, and records symptoms,
f01-143-06|and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them.
f01-147-00|He may never have had the disease himself but he
f01-147-01|can nevertheless identify it. Similarly the psychologist has
f01-147-02|to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
f01-147-03|all kinds of processes in other people, whether or not they
f01-147-04|correspond with anything in his own experience. We know
f01-147-05|very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
f01-147-06|provide our schemas, nor do we need to know as far as
f01-147-07|psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
f01-147-08|the neuro-physiologists.
f02-000-00|The numerically largest group, consisting of male
f02-000-01|weekly wage-earners up to chargehand level
f02-000-02|and in the works only, excluding the offices, was
f02-000-03|therefore selected. A detailed age-structure was
f02-000-04|compiled from personnel department records,
f02-000-05|revealing that there were ( at that time) seven-
f02-000-06|teen men seventy years of age or older,
f02-000-07|thirty-three aged sixty-four years, and sixty-
f02-000-08|five just fifty years of age.
f02-003-00|A small panel was formed, not on a formally representative
f02-003-01|basis but rather of energetic and concerned individuals,
f02-003-02|from various levels in the firm. In due course
f02-003-03|the panel decided to seek further insight into the
f02-003-04|problems faced by older workers, and approached
f02-003-05|those seventy years of age or older.
f02-017-00|The Rubery, Owen scheme is now in its
f02-017-01|fourth year, and opportunity has been taken
f02-017-02|to revise the course in the light of
f02-017-03|experience. Topics for the six weekly meetings
f02-017-04|of one-and-a-half hours ( each held half in
f02-017-05|company time, half in the man's time) are
f02-017-06|now as follows: 1. Personal adjustment 2. Health
f02-017-07|3. Work and leisure 4. Living arrangements
f02-017-08|5. Financial planning 6. Final discussion
f02-020-00|The weekend conference for the men and their wives,
f02-020-01|which takes place at company expense in a country or
f02-020-02|resort hotel, includes an address on ' The Woman's Point
f02-020-03|of View ' and one on ' Making the Most of Health '. Separate
f02-020-04|discussions are arranged for the wives in addition to the
f02-020-05|plenary sessions. Of the men reaching fifty years of age
f02-020-06|since the scheme started, 125 ( 37.2 per cent) have
f02-020-07|taken part.
f02-030-00|The original scheme was planned to provide short re-
f02-030-01|fresher courses at the ages of fifty-five and sixty:
f02-030-02|the first of these is due in 1963. Meanwhile, each
f02-030-03|' graduate ' is encouraged to seek help and advice in
f02-030-04|working out his ideas, either through the company's
f02-030-05|personnel department or by an approach to
f02-030-06|members of the panel responsible for the scheme.
f02-033-00|The latter do not regard themselves as expert
f02-033-01|advisers, but are prepared to seek out the
f02-033-02|appropriate sources of information or advice.
f02-033-03|Towards the end of 1956, Mr. Daniel Grant,
f02-033-04|an Employee Relations Officer of
f02-033-05|Rolls-Royce Ltd. and a member of the
f02-033-06|Workers' Educational Association, submitted
f02-033-07|to the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Dr. Andrew
f02-033-08|Hood, a copy of his report on an enquiry
f02-033-09|he had made into the problems that beset
f02-033-10|older workers and the effects of retirement
f02-033-11|Hugentobler Roger
f02-036-00|The Lord Provost, having studied the report on ' The Morale and
f02-036-01|Health of Retired Workers ', and being satisfied that the matters
f02-036-02|raised were of considerable importance to the citizens of
f02-036-03|Glasgow and warranted further study, set an informal
f02-036-04|committee representative of bodies particularly concerned with
f02-036-05|the welfare of older people to examine the report and
f02-036-06|its implications and to consider the advisability of
f02-036-07|arranging a Conference on Preparation for and
f02-036-08|Occupational Activities on Retirement.
f02-038-00|The large attendance and atmosphere of
f02-038-01|this Conference, held in October, 1957,
f02-038-02|reflected not only an increasing awareness
f02-038-03|of the problems of men and women nearing
f02-038-04|or already in retirement but also a strong
f02-038-05|desire on the part of all concerned for
f02-038-06|concerted action towards preparing men
f02-038-07|and women for life in retirement and more
f02-038-08|adequate provision of facilities for
f02-038-09|crafts, hobbies and leisure-time interests
f02-038-10|for those who are retired.
f02-040-00|As a result, the Glasgow Retirement Council came
f02-040-01|into being in April, 1958, with Dr. Andrew Hood as
f02-040-02|chairman and Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary. The
f02-040-03|Council has active committees on Education and
f02-040-04|Preparation for Retirement, and on Occupational
f02-040-05|Centres. The former consists of representatives from
f02-040-06|the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department;
f02-040-07|the Workers' Educational Association; the University
f02-040-08|Extra-Mural Education Committee and departments
f02-040-09|of psychology, education and social science;....
f02-044-00|In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks, Assistant Director
f02-044-01|of Education for Glasgow, that industrial firms might be ready
f02-044-02|to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
f02-044-03|for retirement, their wages paid for the time thus spent. An
f02-044-04|approach was made to about twenty large firms and in Oc-
f02-044-05|tober, 1959, the first experimental day-release course for
f02-044-06|men was organised. Eleven students from seven firms atten-
f02-044-07|ded a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both
f02-044-08|to the men and their employers that the venture was an
f02-044-09|experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
f02-044-10|as the participants.
f02-076-00|1. Are there differences in adjustment to ageing
f02-076-01|and retirement according to the occupational
f02-076-02|level of employees? 2. If so, which occupational
f02-076-03|levels are the better or the poorer prepared
f02-076-04|for successful adjustment to retirement and
f02-076-05|in what aspects? 3. Does the evidence
f02-076-06|obtained support a rationale for adapting
f02-076-07|a pre-retirement planning and preparation
f02-076-08|programme to the needs of older employees
f02-076-09|of different occupational levels?
f03-169-00|Each time you rehearse you will probably put
f03-169-01|things in a different way. All the better! - it will
f03-169-02|sound much more spontaneous on the occasion
f03-169-03|itself. Remember your four names - have the list
f03-169-04|with you if you like - and you simply can't
f03-169-05|be flummoxed! Of course, in any speech a good
f03-169-06|start and a good finish are half the battle.
f03-174-00|So - see the next page! Yes, they are waiting for you.
f03-174-01|But there is no need to be frightened. The audience
f03-174-02|will eat out of your hand - if they like what
f03-174-03|you offer them. A good start will put them in a
f03-174-04|good humour. Ladies and gentlemen! I 'm afraid
f03-174-05|I have not had much experience of public speaking.
f03-182-00|But that 's a terrible way to begin! Why tell them you
f03-182-01|are a novice? It 's their interest you want - not their
f03-182-02|sympathy. And you want to get it from the word
f03-182-03|GO! Try something like this: It is said that tele-
f03-182-04|vision keeps people at home. But you, at any
f03-182-05|rate, have proved that wrong. And they say, too,
f03-182-06|that television makes its appeal to those of lesser
f03-182-07|intelligence.
f03-191-00|May I suggest that you have proved that
f03-191-01|right! Congratulations! And away you go into
f03-191-02|your speech. Take some thought, too, for your ending.
f03-191-03|Thank you for listening to me so patiently. A political
f03-191-04|candidate often used that finish. No wonder he
f03-191-05|didn't get in! Instead he might have ended
f03-191-06|this way: Well, those are my views.
f04-004-00|When he learned what was causing the commotion he
f04-004-01|became greatly alarmed, and after the body had been
f04-004-02|taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
f04-004-03|grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
f04-004-04|Camp, aged thirty-three, the girl who was to have
f04-004-05|been his bride. There was little doubt of how
f04-004-06|she had met her death, and even less that it
f04-004-07|had been murder.
f04-007-00|She had been struck several times with a blunt
f04-007-01|instrument, and her head was smashed in.
f04-007-02|There were signs of a violent struggle, blood
f04-007-03|on the cushions and floor, and the remains
f04-007-04|of her broken umbrella. But a pair of bone
f04-007-05|cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
f04-007-06|to provide the only possible clue to the killer.
f04-011-00|The body was examined, and it was definitely
f04-011-01|established that no sexual assault had taken place.
f04-011-02|It seemed probable that the motive had been
f04-011-03|robbery, and this was further confirmed when a
f04-011-04|check was made with the woman's relations in
f04-011-05|Hounslow. Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
f04-011-06|Good Intent, a public-house in Walworth. Her day
f04-011-07|off was Thursday, and before coming up to London
f04-011-08|in the evening she had called on her two sisters,
f04-011-09|one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
f04-011-10|other at Hounslow, where she kept a shop.
f04-016-00|Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon,
f04-016-01|and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M., where
f04-016-02|she had tea with her other sister, and then
f04-016-03|went to catch the 7.42. Her sister saw her
f04-016-04|to the station, helping her with some of
f04-016-05|her packages. This sister was able to establish
f04-016-06|that she had carried a green purse and
f04-016-07|had bought a railway ticket.
f04-020-00|But both purse and ticket, and the packages, were gone when the body
f04-020-01|was found at Waterloo. Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
f04-020-02|likely that she had been carrying much money. A porter at Hounslow
f04-020-03|supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
f04-020-04|compartment when the train left, but this did not help much, since it
f04-020-05|had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo.
f04-024-00|The police began a systematic search of the line -
f04-024-01|no easy task, but one in which patience and method
f04-024-02|paid off. At a spot on the embankment between
f04-024-03|Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
f04-024-04|pestle such as chemists use, with some hairs
f04-024-05|sticking to it. The murder weapon, more than likely,
f04-024-06|and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
f04-024-07|killer to book in modern times.
f04-028-00|But in 1897, alas! there was no fingerprint bureau,
f04-028-01|no experts to check and photograph any ' dabs ' it
f04-028-02|might have yielded. It was a tough case to
f04-028-03|tackle, and Superintendent Robinson, of the L.S.W.R.
f04-028-04|Police, and Chief Inspector Marshall, of Scotland
f04-028-05|Yard, combined forces in the investigation. While
f04-028-06|accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
f04-028-07|attacked for the sake of robbery, they did not
f04-028-08|overlook the possibility that this might have
f04-028-09|disguised another motive, and a thorough check
f04-028-10|of her former men friends and acquaintances began.
g01-000-00|A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was
g01-000-01|imprisoned in England. His son, in revenge, was
g01-000-02|harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg,
g01-000-03|and doing it to some purpose. John Philpot,
g01-000-04|one of that new class of merchant financiers
g01-000-05|which the city of London was now producing, fitted,
g01-000-06|equipped and manned a fleet from his own
g01-000-07|resources, and captured the young Mercer in a
g01-000-08|brilliant Channel fight.
g04-003-00|Dr. Davidson said he would go for
g04-003-01|a walk over the fields while we attended
g04-003-02|to our business. To my amusement,
g04-003-03|when we met at tea at the rectory
g04-003-04|after the Dedication, the Archbishop
g04-003-05|said he had been stopped by
g04-003-06|a farmer in a field. He seemed
g04-003-07|rather indignant, but we took the
g04-003-08|episode without a smile till afterwards.
g04-007-00|The Hall proved most useful, especially in winter
g04-007-01|when the distance to the church deterred many from
g04-007-02|coming to Sunday Evensong. We managed to furnish
g04-007-03|a table with cross and candles, and the people
g04-007-04|appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
g04-007-05|as for more secular purposes. In 1910 Dr. Talbot
g04-007-06|was translated to Winchester, and Dr. Hubert
g04-007-07|Burge became Bishop of Southwark.
g04-011-00|Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
g04-011-01|work in connection with Higher Religious Education, and
g04-011-02|to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
g04-011-03|Union. This meant organizing lectures and courses of
g04-011-04|religious instruction through the Diocese, and I
g04-011-05|also found myself a member of the Diocesan
g04-011-06|Conference, where I remember introducing myself as
g04-011-07|the incumbent of the highest church in the
g04-011-08|Diocese.
g04-014-00|There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
g04-014-01|some quarters, until I explained that my church
g04-014-02|was 800 feet high above the sea level! The
g04-014-03|work was growing pretty heavy, and we managed
g04-014-04|to get a stipendiary layman who could help
g04-014-05|among the children and young people.
g04-017-00|It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
g04-017-01|in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play. The place and its people were
g04-017-02|to play an important part in my life. For five years in succession till
g04-017-03|war broke out in 1914, I spent my summer holidays there and became
g04-017-04|very intimate with the people and the environs. Every year between the
g04-017-05|Passion Plays, an interval of ten years, another play would be
g04-017-06|performed at the small theatre in the village, when new talent would
g04-017-07|be discovered and trained.
g04-026-00|First of all simple part-songs: I found only one member who had
g04-026-01|any idea of reading music. This was the village doctor who was an
g04-026-02|old school friend at Clifton. He could sustain the tenor part quite well
g04-026-03|and lead the others. As for basses and altos the conductor had to
g04-026-04|teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and by
g04-026-05|the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
g04-026-06|could render simple part-singing tolerably well.
g04-032-00|Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
g04-032-01|Wedding Feast. ' Enthusiasm grew, and in a few more months we
g04-032-02|gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster,
g04-032-03|and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector.
g04-032-04|Friends from Limpsfield, in addition to the villagers, came up,
g04-032-05|and we were all happy.
g04-077-00|Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
g04-077-01|were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen. Life was
g04-077-02|in those years more than busy. We now had a vicarage next
g04-077-03|to the church, and I was most fortunate in having for eight
g04-077-04|years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
g04-077-05|well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
g04-077-06|church.
g04-081-00|On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
g04-081-01|Purley she offered to come and look after me. She was
g04-081-02|a real treasure, of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic
g04-081-03|things, a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy, '
g04-081-04|who was the only other occupant of the house when
g04-081-05|Mr. Evitt had gone.
g04-088-00|We gathered together a splendid Sunday
g04-088-01|afternoon service at the church, each child
g04-088-02|being given a number which, as they came into
g04-088-03|church, they could just whisper to
g04-088-04|the superintendent who filled in the regi-
g04-088-05|ster at her own home. Each child had a
g04-088-06|picture given them and the lesson was
g04-088-07|largely based on this. It was on a
g04-088-08|stamp which could be stuck in
g04-088-09|their book, and there was quite a
g04-088-10|clamour for back stamps if a child
g04-088-11|had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
g04-092-00|It was quite amusing to see how much
g04-092-01|the children enjoyed the service, and I heard
g04-092-02|of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
g04-092-03|naughty child with the penalty of not being
g04-092-04|allowed to come to the Children's Church
g04-092-05|on Sunday afternoon. I hope the threat
g04-092-06|kept them good in the week, but anyway
g04-092-07|they were a most delightful lot, and
g04-092-08|it is a great joy to meet them now
g04-092-09|fifty years afterwards when so many
g04-092-10|are parents or even grandparents
g04-095-00|Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
g04-095-01|me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
g04-095-02|lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
g04-095-03|continuing till old age to-day. When I went
g04-095-04|to St. Mark's, the first contact I made was
g04-095-05|with the Vicar's Warden, Mr. F. W. Charlton
g04-095-06|and his family, the youngest of whose three
g04-095-07|sons was just coming into the world in this year
g04-095-08|of 1913.
g04-098-00|From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
g04-098-01|deep friendship which I have taken with me through
g04-098-02|all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry. Mr. and
g04-098-03|Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
g04-098-04|years of war, when most lives were upset and
g04-098-05|some tempers were easily frayed, the most
g04-098-06|loyal and devoted friends.
g04-101-00|Their homes - for since those years they have
g04-101-01|lived on in Purley - have always been
g04-101-02|havens of rest, and the welcome has never
g04-101-03|failed. Their three boys, now successful men,
g04-101-04|were in our Children's Church from the
g04-101-05|outset, and when we don't see one
g04-101-06|another we do not forget.
g04-104-00|In those early years 1914-18, life was very full
g04-104-01|both in the parish and in the wider war activities.
g04-104-02|The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in
g04-104-03|Bavaria, asked me if I would do something for two wards
g04-104-04|at the Royal Herbert Hospital, full of war prisoners.
g04-104-05|I was very glad to help in this way, and visited them
g04-104-06|frequently, establishing at once a friendly contact with
g04-104-07|the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
g04-104-08|someone who knew their native villages.
g04-108-00|I could at once notice the great antagonism
g04-108-01|between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
g04-108-02|scorned these more simple country folk.
g05-087-00|Less than no response from the Russian side led
g05-087-01|one to fear that the event might well have the
g05-087-02|outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
g05-087-03|lead to disaster. Then there had been much talk of
g05-087-04|the setting up among the German population of a
g05-087-05|general system of" francs-tireurs", to be named
g05-087-06|" Werewolves".
g05-094-00|The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
g05-094-01|more than a fantasy. Thanks to the good
g05-094-02|sense of the front line soldiers, the
g05-094-03|meeting of East and West was marked by
g05-094-04|the use of no weapon more lethal than
g05-094-05|vodka. And the effect on the German people
g05-094-06|of the first ten years of the promised
g05-094-07|thousand of Nazi rule, so far from creating
g05-094-08|a spirit of warlike frenzy, had produced
g05-094-09|universally a dull bewildered apathy.
g05-098-00|So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the
g05-098-01|" Werewolves" that we had contemplated the necessity of very
g05-098-02|special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen. Particular
g05-098-03|hatred, we felt, was bound to be aimed at the representatives of
g05-098-04|those who had, over the years, spread such ghastly havoc, destruction
g05-098-05|and death over Germany, causing such wholesale slaughter among
g05-098-06|men, women and children, old and young alike.
g06-011a-00|By the end of the month he still delighted in
g06-011a-01|Naples. He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
g06-011a-02|much as his health permitted him to enjoy any-

h04-000-00|Nevertheless, average net family income
h04-000-01|was appreciably higher in families with
h04-000-02|several children than in those with only,
h04-000-03|many of which were incomplete families
h04-000-04|of younger parents with lower earnings,
h04-000-05|and of course with lower tax reliefs and
h04-000-06|no family allowances. The rise in net family
h04-000-07|incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great-
h04-000-08|est for childless couples, especially older
h04-000-09|couples ( probably because of the
h04-007-00|Compared with 1958, the expenditure index for 1959
h04-007-01|showed increases of 4 to 6 per cent for couples without
h04-007-02|children and those with one child, and much smaller
h04-007-03|changes for couples with several children. The quantity
h04-007-04|index, which has risen only slowly since 1956, was
h04-007-05|almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more
h04-007-06|children, but rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult
h04-007-07|households and by 1-2 per cent for younger childless
h04-007-08|couples and couples with one child.
h04-021-00|As in 1958, younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent
h04-021-01|more per calorie than the national average, and families
h04-021-02|with four or more children 19 per cent less. The only
h04-021-03|substantial change was in families with three children,
h04-021-04|for whom the index declined from 91 to 88. Table 27
h04-021-05|also shows the corresponding values of an index which
h04-021-06|compares the prices paid by different types of household
h04-021-07|for the commodities constituting the average household
h04-021-08|diet in 1959.
h04-025-00|For all foods the range was from 3.6 per cent above the national average
h04-025-01|in younger two-adult households to 4.8 per cent below in families with
h04-025-02|four or more children, compared with +3.6 to -5.4 per cent in 1958
h04-025-03|and +2.8 to -2.6 per cent in 1957. As with the price of energy index,
h04-025-04|the only noteworthy change was for households with three children,
h04-025-05|in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the average for
h04-025-06|all households in the sample.

h05-012-01|are highway payments, clearance payments ( for clearing remains of

h05-012-03|differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of
h05-012-04|works payments, the sums paid under these heads have the
h05-012-05|common feature that they are all payments in respect of works

k04-017-00|' Are you enjoying yourself, Olimpia? ' she
k04-017-01|asked idly, tapping the girl's cheek lightly with
k04-017-02|her fan, in passing; but she did not wait for
k04-017-03|the answer. Disturbed by vague uneasiness, she
k04-017-04|was wondering whether Olimpia had been
k04-017-05|watching her talk with Orsini. Surely she
k04-017-06|could not have overheard anything they
k04-017-07|said? A moment's reflection reassured her
k04-017-08|on that point, for she was certain no one
k04-017-09|had been standing near them.
k04-022-00|However, something inimical in the girl's look
k04-022-01|put Vittoria on guard. ' Santa Maria! These spying
k04-022-02|eyes! ' she thought, bitterly. Doria was continually
k04-022-03|stopping on the way, to point out, with childish pride,
k04-022-04|objects of beauty or interest. Vittoria, on the
k04-022-05|fringe of the party, caught snatches of this
k04-022-06|information, which held no interest for her:
k04-022-07|'... now this sapphire...
n02-146-00|She was tempted to laugh, but it was as though that barb still stuck
n02-146-01|in her quivering flesh." You 've an answer - of sorts - for everything," she
n02-146-02|said shortly." Personally I 've no more to say, so I suggest we get
n02-146-03|along." To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses
n02-146-04|where Hubert had been living to find the old man stowing in
n02-146-05|leisurely fashion his few possessions into a ramshackle and
n02-146-06|incredibly ancient car, surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives.
p06-242-00|Philip bristled. ' It was never our intention
p06-242-01|to have one of those carnival affairs, ' he
p06-242-02|retorted and in that second, he became the man of
p06-242-03|success exerting authority. Sandra watched her father's
p06-242-04|face pale. Philip, she knew, got on his nerves, but
p06-242-05|everything had gone over her head. It didn't really
p06-242-06|matter what was being said because she was
p06-242-07|no longer a part of it.
p06-248-00|The thought of Nicholas haunted her, the sense of
p06-248-01|loss crucifying. Her father's comment roused her as
p06-248-02|he said, ' I was not talking of a carnival. But I
p06-248-03|presume we shall be allowed to have one or two
p06-248-04|of our friends at the ceremony. '
r02-000-00|He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions
r02-000-01|drawn between ordinary wage-earners and those
r02-000-02|self-employed. By the time his monthly salary
r02-000-03|arrived, the Inland Revenue had already taken
r02-000-04|their share, and there were precious few
r02-000-05|reductions in tax save for wives, children,
r02-000-06|life-insurances or any of the other normal
r02-000-07|encumbrances which Cecil had so far avoided.
r02-003-00|He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the
r02-003-01|provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her
r02-003-02|to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases, but also
r02-003-03|postponed demanding the tax until her financial year
r02-003-04|was ended, audited and agreed by the Inspector. The
r02-003-05|process could, and often did take several years.
r02-006-00|At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake
r02-006-01|had claimed tax relief on the pur-
r02-006-02|chase of several mink coats which,
r02-006-03|it seemed, were necessary to fur-
r02-006-04|ther her career. Alternatively, it
r02-006-05|was reported, she tearfully claimed
r02-006-06|that the warm coats were heating
r02-006-07|appliances and therefore susceptible
r02-006-08|to a depreciation tax allowance
r02-006-09|as plant and machinery. The
r02-010-00|Between all the interested parties, the final
r02-010-01|agreement had been delayed long enough for
r02-010-02|Miss Cheesecake to spend all the money which
r02-010-03|by rights should have been reserved for her tax.
r02-010-04|Discounting one chinchilla jacket, a Rolls-
r02-010-05|Royce and a Sussex manor house, all
r02-010-06|three of which were in her husband's name,
r02-010-07|she now declared herself bankrupt.
r02-013-00|The train drew into another station
r02-013-01|and Cecil, with a further six stops
r02-013-02|to go, was left almost alone in the
r02-013-03|coach. He fumed as he recol-
r02-013-04|lected the long correspondence he
r02-013-05|had had with the Inland Reve-
r02-013-06|nue in an effort to obtain
r02-013-07|tax relief for a jacket used
r02-013-08|solely in the office. ' If the jacket
r02-013-09|is a condition of your employment, '
r02-013-10|the Inspector had written, ' it may
r02-013-11|qualify for relief. '
r02-038-00|' It 's not mine. I wasn't sitting there. ' She blinked
r02-038-01|disdainfully at him and stepped out.
r02-038-02|It was a new briefcase, and as the train jogged along
r02-038-03|the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil.
r02-038-04|He wondered what it contained. Probably the remains
r02-038-05|of someone's lunch or a few secret files.
r02-038-06|He smiled at his own joke.
r02-054-00|It was locked. Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
r02-054-01|when he shook the case there was a rustling thud
r02-054-02|of wads of paper. ' Cor! ' he muttered aloud, ' there 's
r02-054-03|five thousand at least. ' He felt in his jacket pocket
r02-054-04|and pulled out a key ring. In succession he tried
r02-054-05|his own briefcase key, a suitcase key and a
r02-054-06|device designed to lock typewriters.
r02-060-00|Cecil searched in his pockets once
r02-060-01|more and came up with two
r02-060-02|paper-clips. After a few seconds
r02-060-03|of twisting, he roughly thrust a
r02-060-04|bent wire loop into the lock and
r02-060-05|waggled it around vigorously.
r02-060-06|There was a click and the
r02-060-07|briefcase opened. Cecil thrust an
r02-060-08|eager hand inside, his fingers
r02-060-09|groping after wads of five
r02-060-10|pound notes.
r02-065-00|They closed on a single bundle and, fumbling with
r02-065-01|nervous excitement, he pulled it out. His eye
r02-065-02|rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one
r02-065-03|side. ' Old fashioned fivers! ' he muttered again, and
r02-065-04|tried to recall if they were still legal tender. Surely the
r02-065-05|Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never
r02-065-06|break their promise to pay on rude demand, let
r02-065-07|alone on polite request.
r02-070-00|Cecil frowned in disappointment as he focussed upon the
r02-070-01|printing to find no Govr., no Compa., in fact no five pound notes
r02-070-02|at all. He was holding a paper booklet, the top sheet of which
r02-070-03|bore, in large Baskerville type, the words METROPOLITAN
r02-070-04|MONOTECHNIC INSTITUTE ADVANCED ACCOUNTANCY
r02-070-05|COURSE NO. 3. He ruffled the sheets irritably and
r02-070-06|glowered at his own breach of social morality.
r02-078-00|He climbed the stairs, eager to unload the
r02-078-01|guilt-symbol upon the ticket-collector and then
r02-078-02|to emerge carrying his shame unseen, but burning,
r02-078-03|into the night. He reached the barrier and
r02-078-04|fumbled for his contract before thrusting the
r02-078-05|briefcase at the ticket-collector with the firm
r02-078-06|intention of playing the dutiful citizen
r02-078-07|retrieving lost property.
r02-081-00|Sentence Database
r02-081-01|Before he could open his mouth, the collector
r02-081-02|stretched out a hand. ' Watch your step there, sir! Your briefcase
r02-081-03|is hanging open. You 'll have someone shoving their hot
r02-081-04|little hands inside. Here, I 'll do it. ' The collector pressed the twinkling
r02-081-05|catch home with a click. Cecil, irretrievably laden with
r02-081-06|both briefcase and conscience, stumbled away
r02-081-07|into the darkness.
r02-089-00|' HELLO, CECIL. HAD a busy day? ' His mother came into
r02-089-01|the hall as he opened the front door. He nodded irritably
r02-089-02|and, turning his back to her, contrived to slide the brief-
r02-089-03|case into hiding between the do-it-yourself cupboard
r02-089-04|and the polished brass fourteen-pounder shell-case
r02-089-05|which served respectively as coat cupboard and um-
r02-089-06|brella stand. ' You 're later than usual, aren't you? '
r02-089-07|His mother tidied her grey hair in the hall-mirror
r02-089-08|they had once obtained as a free gift in exchange
r02-089-09|for the labels from half a hundredweight of
r02-089-10|Trunk and Greppes Tannin-free Tea.
r02-109-00|Cecil gritted his teeth and glowered at the
r02-109-01|inequity of Miss Cheesecake well-nigh bathing
r02-109-02|in tax-free champagne whilst he had to go
r02-109-03|easy on the immersion heater. ' What is it,
r02-109-04|Cecil? Don't you feel well? ' his mother
r02-109-05|asked solicitously. ' You do look tired.
r02-109-06|Go and get yourself a drink. ' ' Don't
r02-109-07|fuss, mother! I 'm quite well and no more
r02-109-08|tired than usual, and we finished the gin
r02-109-09|last week, you know that. '
r02-117-00|Cecil stepped towards the dining room. ' I 'm
r02-117-01|sure you must be tired, ' his mother insisted.
r02-117-02|' You 're very irritable, anyway. ' ' I 'm NOT tired
r02-117-03|and I 'm NOT irritable. ' ' Very well then. ' His
r02-117-04|mother nodded with understanding. ' You 're not tired.
r02-117-05|Nobody 's tired. Now just you run along
r02-117-06|upstairs and wash your hands whilst I get
r02-117-07|dinner ready. '
r02-127-00|Cecil wriggled irritably under the misplaced management
r02-127-01|of a mother who had failed to realise that a son
r02-127-02|who is nearly bald is no longer a baby. He started to
r02-127-03|climb the stairs, stamping with unnecessary vigour upon
r02-127-04|the treads. ' And don't wipe the dirt off on the
r02-127-05|towel like you did yesterday.
r02-131-00|Your Auntie Edie 's coming in for a cup of tea later and
r02-131-01|you know how she has a good look round everywhere. ' There was
r02-131-02|a tinkle and a thud from beside the coat cupboard. Cecil's
r02-131-03|mother turned around in time to see the briefcase collapse
r02-131-04|against the brass umbrella stand. ' Well now! ' She hurried
r02-131-05|towards it and picked it up.
r02-137-00|' What have we here? A new briefcase! So THAT 'S
r02-137-01|what it 's all about. ' Cecil halted in
r02-137-02|mid-step near the top of the stairs and
r02-137-03|clenched his fists. ' So that 's what
r02-137-04|What 's all about? ' he hissed without
r02-137-05|turning round. She pointed to the
r02-137-06|briefcase. ' So that 's why you are so
r02-137-07|irritable. You thought that I 'd think
r02-137-08|you 'd been extravagant. '
r02-146-00|' But I 'm NOT irritable! ' He rushed down
r02-146-01|the stairs and, snatching the case, ran back
r02-146-02|upstairs with it. ' And I 've NOT been
r02-146-03|extravagant. '" Naughty! ' she called
r02-146-04|after him. ' Mother knows her boy.
r02-146-05|Arnold Olner
r03-002-00|In spite of all the transferred maternity
r03-002-01|she was endowed with by her patients,
r03-002-02|poor Serena was an infant-in-arms as
r03-002-03|a buyer of property. No, not even an
r03-002-04|infant-in-arms but a new-born babe, a
r03-002-05|premature piece of frailty in an oxygen-
r03-002-06|tent of utter innocence. The complexity of
r03-002-07|that innocence was colossal. It had layer
r03-002-08|after layer of illusion to be peeled off and
r03-002-09|replaced with sad knowledgeability.
r03-007-00|It was a nakedness of nai"vety to be
r03-007-01|clothed leaf by leaf with the disappointment
r03-007-02|of experience. Her first illusion consisted in
r03-007-03|the belief that all she need do was to go to
r03-007-04|an agent, visit half a dozen houses in one
r03-007-05|day, choose one, make an offer, put it in
r03-007-06|the hands of a lawyer and go away on her
r03-007-07|holiday while the whole transaction was
r03-007-08|put through.
r03-026-00|Fortunately, however, the fashion for Victorian
r03-026-01|architecture which Mr. John Betjeman had
r03-026-02|started several decades before had caught on
r03-026-03|at last and therefore saved the situation for
r03-026-04|the affluent middle-class, who now had plenty
r03-026-05|of lovely-ugly to be coldly elegant in. All this
r03-026-06|Serena discovered, and more, but in stages. For the
r03-026-07|first thing she did was to make an offer
r03-026-08|on a small pink terraced cottage, two beds,
r03-026-09|two inter-comm. rec., mod. k. and b., sep. W.C.
r03-026-10|small back yard, newly dec., near shops and tube
r03-030-00|The next thing that Serena discovered was that
r03-030-01|she could not afford to buy a house at all.
r03-030-02|And this in spite of having at last managed
r03-030-03|to save the ten percent needed. Or so she
r03-030-04|thought, being then in possession of what
r03-030-05|seemed to her the princely sum of six hund-
r03-030-06|red pounds. The lawyer said:
r03-035-00|" Of course you must count about two hundred
r03-035-01|for legal charges and stamp duties,
r03-035-02|maybe less, depending on the price of the
r03-035-03|house, and whether it has been regis-
r03-035-04|tered. I take it you have a mortgage lined
r03-035-05|up, then, Mrs. - er - Buttery?"" Not yet,
r03-035-06|but the bank would give me a loan, I 'm
r03-035-07|sure."" Er, yes. You have some securities,
r03-035-08|then?"
r03-050-00|His aspect was as dusty as his office, with scurf
r03-050-01|from dusty hair on the dusty shoulders of his black
r03-050-02|suit, cigarette ash down the front, an ashen face
r03-050-03|and yellow sleepy dust in the corners of his pale
r03-050-04|grey eyes. His finger-nails were dirty, though he
r03-050-05|tried to make up for it by constantly paring them
r03-050-06|with the finger-nail of the opposite hand.
r03-056-00|" Yes, well...." He judged that she had been sufficiently
r03-056-01|dazzled and gave a long raucous cough." Only
r03-056-02|cigarettes worth smoking, these. Most unhealthy, English
r03-056-03|ones. Well, now, let me see. I think I can put you onto
r03-056-04|some people who might, I say might, let you have a mortgage on
r03-056-05|this property...."" But, they 're safe, are they? I mean,
r03-056-06|they 're not - money-lenders?"" Mrs. - er - Buttery,
r03-056-07|all mortgage companies are money-lenders.
r03-065-00|That 's rather the point, isn't it?"" No, but I mean -"
r03-065-01|" I know what you mean. You may trust me, Mrs.
r03-065-02|Buttery. I think, however, that you might have
r03-065-03|to revise your ideas about - er - the type of
r03-065-04|property you intend to purchase." She revised
r03-065-05|them. The little man from the Inter-Insular
r03-065-06|( British Archipelago) Insurance Company soon
r03-065-07|saw to that.
r03-084-00|I 'm afraid we can't take yours into account
r03-084-01|at all. It 's a rule of I.I.I. You see, you
r03-084-02|might stop work to have - well, for all sorts of
r03-084-03|reasons, or you might leave him."" But how
r03-084-04|utterly extraordinary," said Serena angrily,
r03-084-05|" you must be living in the nineteenth century."
r03-084-06|" Oh, but it 's a very general rule, Mrs. Buttery,
r03-084-07|you 'll find that no insurance companies,
r03-084-08|or building societies, for that matter, will
r03-084-09|allow for the wife's earnings.
r03-090-00|Our lawyers -"" Who are your lawyers?"
r03-090-01|" Clacton's."" Well, I 'm damned."" Now, let me see,
r03-090-02|you say your husband earns about... yes,
r03-090-03|that would come to... three, carry seven, six
r03-090-04|nines are fifty four - of course we 'd have to
r03-090-05|have some sort of proof, you know, it 's very
r03-090-06|difficult with self-employed persons, carry two.
r03-096-00|Yes. I 'm afraid we couldn't raise this loan to more
r03-096-01|than three thousand three fifty at the most. Now you
r03-096-02|could get quite a nice little semi-detached house in
r03-096-03|Grimstead for three thousand, that 's where I live, just
r03-096-04|before the green belt, lovely and modern, you know.
r03-096-05|I forgot to tell you, we don't usually lend any
r03-096-06|house built earlier than 1918."
r03-110-00|" You see," she propounded to Rupert after her last patient
r03-110-01|had gone," we can get three thousand three fifty,
r03-110-02|perhaps a little more if we can cheat your earnings
r03-110-03|a bit. I 'm sure you could raise the rest from
r03-110-04|one of your publishers, get two books commissioned
r03-110-05|and write them later. I 've got a bit owing too.
r03-110-06|Now, I saw some flats in Hendon for four thou,
r03-110-07|and some in West Hampstead for four two fifty,
r03-110-08|two beds, two reception, k. and b., just think,
r03-110-09|our own bathroom.
r03-115-00|Much more spacious than that poky little cottage,
r03-115-01|which wasn't a bit practical really, the
r03-115-02|reception room was too small when divided
r03-115-03|and too big when not.
r06-000-00|Vence is a sober spot, half way between small
r06-000-01|town and village, pigeon grey, sly with arches, and
r06-000-02|linked by a whispering plot of fountains. In the main
r06-000-03|tree-heavy square you can sit in the autumn
r06-000-04|sunshine, still burning like a half-cooled iron,
r06-000-05|sip pastis and read the local newspapers.
r06-003-00|One called La Patriote is Communist, and at the time
r06-003-01|of our arrival it was throwing huge over-ripe verbal
r06-003-02|tomatoes at General de Gaulle. One side of this square
r06-003-03|is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar. For one
r06-003-04|day, with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative, we had been
r06-003-05|hunting for furnished rooms, and had given up, when an
r06-003-06|elderly lady, the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest,
r06-003-07|had firmly closed the door in our noses.
r06-007-00|' It is a pity, ' said Mart, ' because it would have been
r06-007-01|a good address. ' Now, after a woman's radar look,
r06-007-02|she decided Pierre would solve our problems. This
r06-007-03|was true, Pierre was a true Provenc*?6al, thin and
r06-007-04|yellow as lemon peel, wrestling with some gnawing rat
r06-007-05|of an illness, man of all trades, married to a commanding
r06-007-06|lady who loved small talk and the discreet
r06-007-07|accumulation of money.
r06-011-00|We went in. There were a few people in the bar,
r06-011-01|elderly, well-off, artistic, who, you felt, had made a hard
r06-011-02|bargain for giving up. ' I have furnished rooms, ' said
r06-011-03|Pierre, ' and all mod cons. ' The price was 16,000 francs a
r06-011-04|month. ' Yes, ' we said immediately, even before viewing.
r06-011-05|We were shown around by Pierre.
r06-018-00|The flat was on the third floor; two rooms; soft Provenc*?
r06-018-01|6al view; good intimate furnishing and colour; running
r06-018-02|hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up,
r06-018-03|basin and bidet; own private, modern lavatory. The
r06-018-04|first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence.
r06-018-05|We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
r06-018-06|eruption of turtle-doves.
r06-022-00|This was strange, even magic, because the owner's
r06-022-01|name was Pierre Tortorolo which, in Nicoison Italian means
r06-022-02|' turtledove '. Pierre Turtledove. When we woke up properly it
r06-022-03|was raining, an even more hopeless rain than London, and we
r06-022-04|looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
r06-022-05|curling white breath of the mountains. The land looked
r06-022-06|like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
r06-022-07|shame.
r06-027-00|There they were, in fact, below us, eight of them.
r06-027-01|Four of them were flattened on the window sills, two
r06-027-02|immolated on a nearby roof top, the other pair copulating.
r06-027-03|We had a morning at Pierre's. He talked about people.
r06-027-04|Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
r06-027-05|Lawrence. He was here, near the railway station, three or
r06-027-06|four years. During this period he wrote a book,
r06-027-07|The Lover of Lady Chatterly.
r06-035-00|No, he hadn't read it; Madame did all the
r06-035-01|reading. Lawrence died in this very place.
r06-035-02|He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
r06-035-03|again. No, he couldn't really remember
r06-035-04|him, he was one of the crowd. The
r06-035-05|sun came out; Mart went shopping; I
r06-035-06|sat in the square reading the Patriote.
r06-041-00|There was a front-page rear-attack on de
r06-041-01|Gaulle, and the rest of the paper was given up
r06-041-02|to murders, apart for an outcry against a
r06-041-03|proposal to drop radio-active material into
r06-041-04|the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
r06-041-05|Raphael. All the murders were well documented
r06-041-06|and had the air of being written by an
r06-041-07|ingenious, but mad film director of the
r06-041-08|Thirties.
r06-044-00|They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses.
r06-044-01|Monsieur H, for instance, had been clubbed and
r06-044-02|throttled to death by his wife, children and
r06-044-03|father-in-law, after muddling up some sheep
r06-044-04|while the worse for drink. The family
r06-044-05|group then sat down for a late lunch
r06-044-06|before the father-in-law telephoned the police.
r06-044-07|Then again, Monsieur V, owing to family
r06-044-08|troubles, had written to the local
r06-044-09|paper and the superintendent of police,
r06-044-10|informing them that he was on the point
r06-049-00|Monsieur V's house was immediately
r06-049-01|surrounded by firemen and other officials,
r06-049-02|but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned
r06-049-03|a few minutes later from a nearby village,
r06-049-04|apologising for the trouble, but explaining
r06-049-05|that the walls were porous and the
r06-049-06|gas had escaped. General relief was
r06-049-07|expressed, but Monsieur V ( this was
r06-049-08|actually reported in the next issue) returned
r06-049-09|home and shot himself, leaving a note
r06-049-10|which again left his household goods
r06-053-00|Some grim comic relief was provided by
r06-053-01|an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
r06-053-02|who hid himself in a bush and imitated
r06-053-03|a blackbird. Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
r06-053-04|was after this very bird and shot the farm-
r06-053-05|labourer in the face. All, however,
r06-053-06|ended well, reported the paper, since the
r06-053-07|pellets were easily removed and the
r06-053-08|labourer was able to return to work the
r06-053-09|same afternoon.
r06-057-00|We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta.
r06-057-01|You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
r06-057-02|way. In the middle of the journey is a
r06-057-03|valley with a sea of vines and olives
r06-057-04|and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
r06-057-05|the hoe. Rising from the flecked sea are
r06-057-06|islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
r06-057-07|towns, grey, rose-headed mariners clinging
r06-057-08|like limpets to the rock.
r06-062-00|There is a curd of morning smoke and
r06-062-01|a muffled bell taps the sky. Here we
r06-062-02|stopped, as in fine weather we always
r06-062-03|stopped. Down below is the village of
r06-062-04|Cagnes, but between are pockets of
r06-062-05|heat and cold like the hands of
r06-062-06|friends or strangers, and a flurry of
r06-062-07|early smells, the dark bosoms of
r06-062-08|beech and the thin pine fingers
r06-062-09|kissed by the sun.
r06-066-00|Then here was Nice, and the old holiday
r06-066-01|sea, blue as a new school exercise
r06-066-02|book. The same old Nice, creamy,
r06-066-03|vulgar, out of time, bitter-sweet with
r06-066-04|the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
r06-066-05|prostitutes, edging past grubby grandeur
r06-066-06|to the old sleeping port. This, and
r06-066-07|Paris, were my ruined pavilions, and I
r06-066-08|could catch the taste of dead dreams on
r06-066-09|my tongue like spray.
r06-070-00|We parked the Lambretta opposite the
r06-070-01|Negresco, and went to the beach to
r06-070-02|have a swim. Amazing bedlam rocked
r06-070-03|in our eyes. The sea boiled with waves,
r06-070-04|they galloped to the walls and spumed
r06-070-05|over the Promenade des Anglais. A huge
r06-070-06|crowd had collected. There were firemen
r06-070-07|and policemen and ambulances, and the
r06-070-08|eyes of the spectators were hard with
r06-070-09|disaster.
r06-076-00|They all had that neat look of
r06-076-01|Mediterranean people to whom nothing
r06-076-02|could ever happen, the chosen sane, the
r06-076-03|uncuckolded, unrobbed, sheltered from
r06-076-04|disease and accident by doctors, God and
r06-076-05|the municipality. Yet, at any time now,
r06-076-06|the bell would ring for them - the gilded
r06-076-07|love house, the mad grandmother or the
r06-076-08|bloody child at the crossroads.
r06-090-00|It was growing cold. We left the
r06-090-01|crowd and drove back to Vence.
r06-090-02|The cool evening perfumes stood
r06-090-03|beckoning at the corners of the roads.
r06-090-04|Mart is unable to smell ( her sense
r06-090-05|organs were impaired years ago), and
r06-090-06|I had to explain the low, sharp and
r06-090-07|sweet signals in the air. When we
r06-090-08|got back home we felt exhausted.
r06-090-09|London sickness ( a sense of guilt,
r06-090-10|mingled with the memory of sandwiches
r06-097-00|We went straight to bed and slept until
r06-097-01|the turtle-doves drummed up the
r06-097-02|sun. The next morning, in the square
r06-097-03|opposite Pierre's, I read about the Nice
r06-097-04|beach catastrophe in the Patriote.
r06-097-05|Mart had been right, the body had been
r06-097-06|a woman's. It belonged to a Madame
r06-097-07|N. Enquiries had been made in the
r06-097-08|neighbourhood, and it transpired that
r06-097-09|Madame N's husband had made an
r06-097-10|arrangement with the dead lady's sister
r06-103-00|The sister, able to swim, had returned
r06-103-01|to the shore, but instead of returning
r06-103-02|to her brother-in-law ( with whom
r06-103-03|she had an illicit relationship), she
r06-103-04|went to her fiance*?2's house and
r06-103-05|confessed everything. Her fiance*?2
r06-103-06|reported her to the police, and then jumped
r06-103-07|off a cliff near Monte Carlo.
r06-106-00|The day I promised to take Catherine
r06-106-01|down to visit my young friend Philip
r06-106-02|at his school in the country, we were
r06-106-03|to leave at eleven, but she arrived
r06-106-04|at nine. Her blue dress was new,
r06-106-05|and so were her fashionable shoes. Her
r06-106-06|hair had just been done. She looked
r06-106-07|more than ever like a pink and gold
r06-106-08|Renoir girl who expects everything from
r06-106-09|life.
r06-111-00|Catherine lives in a white house
r06-111-01|overlooking the sweeping brown tides
r06-111-02|of the river. She helped me clean up my
r06-111-03|flat with a devotion which said that
r06-111-04|she felt small flats were altogether more
r06-111-05|romantic than large houses. We drank
r06-111-06|tea, and talked mainly about Philip, who,
r06-111-07|being 15, has pure stern tastes in every-
r06-111-08|thing from food to music.
r06-115-00|Catherine looked at the books lying
r06-115-01|around his room, and asked if she
r06-115-02|might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
r06-115-03|to read on the train. Catherine is 13.
r06-115-04|I suggested she might find them dif-
r06-115-05|ficult, but she said, ' Philip reads them,
r06-115-06|doesn't he? ' During the journey I read
r06-115-07|newspapers and watched her pretty
r06-115-08|frowning face as she turned the
r06-115-09|pages of Babel, for she was determined
r06-115-10|to let nothing get between her and
r06-121-00|At the school, which is charming, ci-
r06-121-01|vilised and expensive, the two children
r06-121-02|walked together across green fields, and
r06-121-03|I followed, seeing how the sun gilded
r06-121-04|their bright friendly heads turned
r06-121-05|towards each other as they talked. In
r06-121-06|Catherine's left hand she carried the
r06-121-07|stories of Isaac Babel. After lunch we
r06-121-08|went to the pictures. Philip allowed
r06-121-09|# it to be seen that he thought going to
r06-121-10|the pictures just for the fun of it was
r06-126-00|For his sake we chose the more
r06-126-01|serious of the two films that were
r06-126-02|showing in the little town. It was
r06-126-03|about a good priest who helped cri-
r06-126-04|minals in New York. His goodness, how-
r06-126-05|ever, was not enough to prevent one
r06-126-06|of them from being sent to the gas
r06-126-07|chamber; and Philip and I waited with
r06-126-08|Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
r06-126-09|crying and could face the light of a golden
r06-126-10|evening.
r06-130-00|At the entrance of the cinema the
r06-130-01|doorman was lying in wait for anyone
r06-130-02|who had red eyes. Grasping Catherine
r06-130-03|by her suffering arm, he said bitterly:
r06-130-04|' Yes, why are you crying, he had to be
r06-130-05|punished for his crime, didn't he? ' Cathe-
r06-130-06|rine stared at him, incredulous. Philip
r06-130-07|rescued her by saying with disdain:
r06-130-08|' Some people don't know right from wrong
r06-130-09|even when its demonstrated to them. '
r06-137-00|The doorman turned his attention
r06-137-01|to the next red-eyed emerger from the
r06-137-02|dark; and we went on together to
r06-137-03|the station, the children silent because
r06-137-04|of the cruelty of the world. Finally Catherine
r06-137-05|said, her eyes wet again: ' I think its all
r06-137-06|absolutely beastly, and I can't bear to think
r06-137-07|about it. ' And Philip said: ' But we 've got
r06-137-08|to think about it, don't you see, because
r06-137-09|if we don't it 'll just go on and on, don't
r06-137-10|you see? '
r06-143-00|In the train going back to London I sat
r06-143-01|beside # Catherine. She had the stories open
r06-143-02|in front of her, but she said: ' Philip 's awfully lucky.
r06-143-03|I wish I went to that school. Did you notice
r06-143-04|that girl who said hullo to him in the garden?
